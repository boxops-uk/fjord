//! `fjord query <db> <QUERY>`.
//!
//! **Always over the wire**, and that is §2's rule 1 rather than a simplification: a
//! bare name means "ask the local server", and there is no silent fallback to opening
//! the directory because a server may be holding it (`ops-I1`). With none listening
//! the answer is a psql-style actionable error, not a directory read.
//!
//! Rows are **streamed**: pulled one at a time and written as they arrive, so a result
//! of any size crosses this process without being held in it. The one exception is the
//! aligned table, which cannot know its column widths until the last row — see
//! [`crate::rows`], and use `--format raw` or `--format count` when that matters.
