//! `fjord schema check | fingerprint | diff` — [operations §5](../../../../website/content/operations.md).
//!
//! The three questions a schema can be asked **before any database holds one**, which
//! is what makes them worth having: a schema is a build artifact long before it is an
//! artifact's contents, and every one of these answers is cheaper to get from a file
//! than from a database that was created wrongly.
//!
//! Nothing here opens fjall or talks to a server. `diff` reads a database's *sidecar
//! and embedded copy* when given a name, which is `ops-I7` again — the filesystem is
//! the catalog, so a comparison works while a server holds everything under the root.
