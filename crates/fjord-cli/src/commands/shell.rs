//! `fjord shell <db>` — the REPL, always over the wire.
//!
//! **Remote-first, and that is the point rather than a limitation**
//! ([operations §5](../../../../website/content/operations.md)). The shell is the permanent
//! exerciser of the wire format: every query a person types here is a real handshake, a
//! real stream and a real page of `DATA_ROW` frames, so a format change that the tests
//! happen not to cover still cannot survive somebody using the tool.
//!
//! # It compiles what you type
//!
//! The line is compiled **here**, against the schema the server said it serves
//! ([`Connection::served_schema`]) — so a mistake is a caret under the word, in colour,
//! before anything crosses the socket, and `:plan` and `:type` are answerable at all.
//!
//! Fetching the schema is what makes that honest rather than hopeful. A database
//! carries the schema it was created against ([I13](../../../../website/content/invariants.md#i13)), so
//! compiling against this tool's *built-in* one would be checking a query against a
//! schema nobody is using. The one assumption left is that the server's compiler is
//! this compiler: against a server of a different build the local answer can differ,
//! and the rule is that the **server** decides what runs — a query it refuses is
//! refused with its own message, whatever this one thought.
//!
//! # `:more` is what this was built for
//!
//! A result here is a **bookmark**, not a buffer. `:more` reads the next page and
//! stops; nothing is held at either end, because the place is kept by the *stream*
//! staying open — server-side, parked on a full outbound queue with a bytes-only cursor
//! whose snapshot was released at the chunk boundary
//! ([I8](../../../../website/content/invariants.md#i8)). A pause of a millisecond and a pause of an hour
//! cost the server the same thing.
//!
//! [I4](../../../../website/content/invariants.md#i4) — resume equals an uninterrupted
//! run, the most heavily tested machinery in this project — has exactly one interactive
//! exerciser: `:more` is a person holding a cursor across a round trip, and
//! [`pages_concatenate_to_an_uninterrupted_run`](tests) is that claim as a test.
//!
//! # `:expand` is the other thing a wire client could not do
//!
//! A row carries a reference as a `FactId`, so a query over a code index answers with
//! numbers naming facts a person cannot see — and sigla cannot ask what one names, since
//! it names a fact by its key. `:expand` asks the *protocol*
//! ([`kinds::FETCH`](fjord_wire::kinds::FETCH)) and shows the fact instead, recursively:
//! `{"to": "#4:1"}` becomes `{"to": {"module": {…}, "name": "encode", "line": 1}}`, which
//! is the same nested shape a producer sends when it writes one. It costs a point read
//! per distinct reference, cached across pages, which is why it is off until asked for.
//!
//! # Errors do not end the session, and which ones do is a rule
//!
//! A [`ClientError::Server`] is the server refusing one *stream* — a query it will not
//! run, a database that has gone — and psql's answer is right: print it and keep the
//! prompt. Anything else (`Io`, `Wire`, `Protocol`) means the conversation itself is
//! broken; the loop says so and opens a new one, because a server restarted under a
//! shell is a hiccup rather than the end of an afternoon.
