//! **The queries the instruments measure, stated once.**
//!
//! Every rung of the measurement ladder — the in-process executor bench, the load
//! generator, the soak, the code-search mix — needs the same questions asked of the same
//! data, or a number from one rung cannot be compared with a number from another. They
//! each stated their own, which is how `loadgen` came to seek `files / 2` — a key that
//! exists only in a corpus it seeded itself, and exists in no real index at all.
//!
//! # Pivots are sampled, never computed
//!
//! A workload that seeks needs a key that is *there*. Against somebody's checkout there
//! is no arithmetic that lands on one, so [`Pivots`] carries values taken out of whatever
//! corpus is loaded. Sampling is deliberately **not** in this module: an in-process bench
//! has a `FjallDb` and a load generator has a socket, and pretending those are the same
//! would mean this module depending on both. What is shared is the shape and the
//! queries — which is the part that has to agree.
//!
//! # A workload states what it answers
//!
//! `fjord_engine::corpus` makes a `Supported` entry carry the rows it returns, for the
//! reason this needs too: a run that returned a different count did not measure what it
//! thought it did, and should say so rather than print a throughput figure. The rows a
//! given corpus answers with are not knowable here, so an instrument fixes them with one
//! unmeasured probe and holds every timed run to it — which is what
//! `examples/engine.rs` does.

/// The four fanouts below are what set it. They are the source layer of the built-in
/// schema, nested exactly as [`fjord_cli::sample_schema`](crate::sample_schema) declares
/// it: a reference names a declaration, which names a module, which names a file. So one
/// `src.Ref` carries a four-deep subgraph, and the thousandth reference to a declaration
/// re-sends the whole chain — which is the redundancy, and is *not* a flaw in the
/// producer. It is what a syntax walk has in hand.
///
/// # Why the counts are predicted rather than probed
///
/// `examples/engine.rs` fixes its row counts with one unmeasured run and holds every
/// timed run to them, because what a real corpus answers is not knowable in advance.
/// Here it is: the arithmetic below is a closed form, so an instrument can assert that
/// the store agrees with the corpus's own statement of itself. A run whose `created`
/// differs from [`Corpus::facts`] did not write the corpus described — a stronger check
/// than reproducibility between runs, because the first run is checked too.
