//! The shell's *terminal*: the highlighter over the compiler's own lexer, the rule for
//! where a line's sigla source begins, the decision about colour, and the table shape
//! behind `:help`. Command *meanings* live with [`crate::commands::shell`], which is why
//! the table is passed in rather than defined here.
//!
//! # Colour is decided once, and off a pipe it is off
//!
//! [`colours_enabled`] answers `NO_COLOR` and "is stdout a terminal" once per process.
//! Everything that paints asks it, so a piped shell writes plain text and a test
//! capturing into a `Vec<u8>` sees exactly what it asserts on.
