//! **The sample code index** — `schemas/code.sigla`, parsed, and the name lookups the
//! rest of this crate's tests, benchmarks and instruments resolve against it.
//!
//! One fact per thing, and everything about a thing pointing at it by
//! [`FactId`](fjord_schema::id::FactId) rather than repeating it. It is the shape the
//! .NET demo and the real Roslyn indexer write, the shape the viewer reads, and the
//! shape every number in `bench/FINDINGS.md` was measured over.
//!
//! **It is not a default, and there is no longer such a thing.** Until 0.0.1 this was
//! *the built-in schema*: what a database got when `create` was not given a path. That
//! made a default decide how every stored row of somebody's database decoded, and made
//! the artifact a property of which build of the tool created it. `--schema` is required
//! now, and what is left here is a **fixture** — one worked example, in one place, so an
//! instrument cannot declare its own and end up measuring a database it could not have
//! written.
//!
//! **Nothing here states a schema.** `schemas/code.sigla` is the single statement, in the
//! language `fjord create --schema` takes, and this module is the two lines that parse it
//! plus the name lookups. What is left to guard is therefore not
//! "does the vector still say what it said" but "does the *file* still declare what the
//! rest of the tree names" — which is what `tests` below asks.
//!
//! **Three layers, and the joins between them are the point.** The source layer any
//! syntax walk can fill — files, modules, declarations, references, their spans, the two
//! search indexes — with the file's own text beside them in `src.FileLine`, which
//! `src.sigla` declares and this file imports. Fifteen more are what a *compiler* and a *build system* know and a syntax walk
//! does not: which project a file is compiled by and into which assembly, what a type
//! extends, what a member overrides, what a parameter's type is spelled as, what the doc
//! comment says. Those are written by
//! [`Boxops.Fjord.Indexer`](../../../clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Indexer/README.md), which has Roslyn and
//! MSBuild to answer them with. A predicate nobody fills is an empty keyspace pair, which
//! costs the ~30 ms it takes to create it and nothing after that.
//!
//! **Three of the twenty-seven are the same data keyed a second way**, and they are here
//! because a predicate leads with one field and two questions want different ones:
//! `src.SearchByName` against `src.Decl`, `src.FileXRef` against `src.Ref`,
//! `src.AttributeOf` and `src.DerivesFrom` against their originals. Each is what a
//! *stored derivation* would materialise ([the roadmap](../../../PLAN.md)); until one can
//! be declared, the producer writes both orders.

///
/// What each predicate is here to show:
///
/// | predicate | shows |
/// |---|---|
/// | `src.File` | a **scalar** key — a path is one string, and needs no record |
/// | `src.Module` | a **reference**, so a module names its file rather than repeating the path |
/// | `src.Decl` | a **value side**, so `D.value` has something to read, plus a second reference |
/// | `src.SearchByName` | **key order is the index**: the same names keyed so a prefix narrows |
/// | `src.Ref` | a **nested record** key field, and two references to two predicates, reached through an open pattern |
/// | `src.Import` | two references to one predicate, which is what a graph edge is |
/// | `src.Project` · `src.Assembly` | scalar keys again, and the two ends of the build layer |
/// | `src.Compilation` | the **crossing**: a project, a target framework, and the assembly the pair produces |
/// | `src.ProjectSource` · `src.ProjectRef` · `src.PackageRef` | edges, which is how a many-to-many is said without arrays |
/// | `src.Package` | a **compound identity** — a package is its name *and* its version, and neither alone |
/// | `src.Member` · `src.Extends` · `src.Implements` · `src.Override` | the declaration graph, all four keyed **container-first** so the fan-out direction is the seek |
/// | `src.Param` | an `Int` in the middle of a key, so a method's parameters come back **in order** |
/// | `src.TypeOf` · `src.Doc` | a key of one field, which is a thing an *attribute* of something else is |
/// | `src.Attribute` | a string leading the key, so `[Obsolete]` everywhere is a seek rather than a scan |
/// | `src.FileLine` | the **wide row**: a file's line table, one fact per line, the text and its offsets on the value side. Declared in `src.sigla` |
///
/// **Why the field order decides the seeks, and why it is declared rather than derived.**
/// A record's fields are stored in the order `schemas/code.sigla` lists them, that order
/// *is* the key order, and a query can only narrow on a leading run of it. So
/// `src.Extends` is declared `{base, type}` because "everything deriving from this" is
/// the question worth a seek; `{iface, type}`, `{container, member}` and
/// `{attribute, target}` are the same choice made three more times. Lowering preserves
/// declaration order for exactly this reason — it does not sort a record's fields.
///
/// Nothing sorts these slices: `flatten` walks the
/// schema's own slice by index and looks each query field up by name, and
/// `fjord_store::fact`'s `the_encoding_order_is_the_declared_order` pins
/// that. An **alphabetical** habit makes the physical key order a *consequence*
/// of naming — which is how a `src.Decl` comes to lead with a line number and a `src.Ref` with
/// a column — the two most expensive keys in the index, both by accident.
///
/// The order is now chosen per predicate and stated in `tests::KEY_ORDER`, which is the
/// guard: a field list that changes silently answers a different question, and asserting
/// the intended order catches that where asserting sortedness only caught it when the
/// intended order happened to be alphabetical.
