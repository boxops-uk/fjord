//! A server on a socket, in this process, for the tests that need one.
//!
//! **Why the tool tests a server in-process at all.** `tests/over_a_server.rs` drives
//! the real binary against a real `fjord serve`, which is the right shape for the
//! lifecycle — it proves the frames crossed a socket between two processes. It is the
//! wrong shape for anything that needs *facts in a database*, because the tool has no
//! command that writes any (file ingestion is unbuilt), and the wrong shape for anything that
//! needs to look at a value the binary does not print.
//!
//! So this stands the same server up behind the same socket, writes facts through the
//! ordinary client, and hands back a path. Nothing here is a shortcut around the wire:
//! every fact below is encoded, framed and interned exactly as a `.NET` producer's are.
