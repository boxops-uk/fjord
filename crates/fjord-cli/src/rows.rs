//! Query rows, rendered for a person or a script.
//!
//! **Client-side, always.** The wire carries the binary format and the server never
//! produces JSON — a decision from the original brief, and the reason `--format` is a
//! flag on a command rather than a field in a request.
//!
//! # Four of the five shapes stream, and the fifth says why it does not
//!
//! A [`Sink`] is handed rows one at a time, as they arrive, and writes as it goes.
//! [`RowFormat::Table`] is the exception: aligning columns needs the widest cell, and
//! the widest cell is not known until the last row. It buffers, and a result too large
//! to hold is a result to ask for in another shape — which is what `raw` and `count`
//! are for, and why `count` exists at all: a measurement of the *server* should not be
//! paying for this file.
//!
//! # JSON is shaped like the head, all the way down
//!
//! A row's structure is the head's, and the [`Desc`] the server sent describes it —
//! **recursively**, field names and all. So a nested record comes out as a nested
//! object rather than as a positional array: `{at = {line = L, col = C}}` reads as
//! `{"at": {"line": 4, "col": 19}}`, which is the shape somebody asked for when they
//! wrote the query. Rendering only the top level by name and the rest by position was
//! the easy half of the same job, and it made every reference-and-span row — the
//! interesting ones — arrive as numbers in an array.
//!
//! A **reference** renders as `"#predicate:sequence"`, the same string the table
//! shows. A raw `u64` would be the id's bytes rather than the id: nothing takes one as
//! input (sigla names a fact by its key, not by its number), so the useful thing is the
//! one a person can read and a script can compare.
//!
//! # An **expanded** reference is the fact, and the schema is what names it
//!
//! `:expand` and `--expand` replace a reference with the fact it names
//! ([`Expander`](fjord_client::Expander)), so what arrives here is a nested fact where
//! the descriptor says `Fact(p)`. The descriptor is not wrong — that *is* what the row
//! carried — it simply has nothing to say about the shape underneath, which is `p`'s key.
//! So this is the one place rendering consults the **schema** rather than the descriptor,
//! and the one reason a [`Sink`] can hold one. Without it the fields still print, in
//! order, which is the same fallback a descriptor mismatch takes.
//!
//! # Colour, when there is a terminal, and jq's colours because they are the ones people
//! know
//!
//! `jq` is what everybody reads JSON through, so its palette is the one a person has
//! already learned: keys bold blue, strings green, punctuation bright, numbers plain
//! (its `JQ_COLORS` default). Copying it costs nothing and means nobody has to learn a
//! second scheme to read the same document.
//!
//! **One deliberate divergence**: a *reference* is yellow, not green, even though it
//! renders as a JSON string. jq has no idea what one is; this tool does, and yellow is
//! what a predicate name is painted everywhere else in it — in a query, in a schema, and
//! now in a row. In a fact database the references are the part you follow, and the
//! palette should say so.
//!
//! Colour is asked of [`crate::prompt::colours_enabled`], which answers `NO_COLOR` and
//! "is stdout a terminal" — so `| jq` and `> file` get plain bytes, exactly as jq's own
//! output does.
