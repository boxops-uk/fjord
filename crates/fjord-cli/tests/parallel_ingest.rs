//! **A database does not depend on how many threads wrote it, or in what order.**
//!
//! The acceptance criterion that decides whether
//! the [striped merge frontier](../../../crates/fjord-store/src/store.rs) is *correct* rather
//! than merely uncontended. `concurrent_interning_of_one_key_creates_one_fact` proves the
//! narrow case — every thread reaching for one key gets one fact. This proves the wide
//! one: run a whole nested corpus three ways and the artifact is the same artifact.
//!
//! # Why identity is the assertion and not fact ids
//!
//! [`ops-I4`](../../../website/content/operations.md) says a database built twice from identical
//! inputs is identical, and it means identical *by content hash* — a multiset over each
//! fact's logical form, no physical `FactId` anywhere in it. That distinction was
//! load-bearing enough to reverse a design decision four documents had recorded as forced
//! (["parallel writes", open decisions](../../../PLAN.md)), and until this file it
//! had never been exercised against anything but a single-threaded, in-order ingest. An
//! invariant nothing has tried to break is a hope.
//!
//! # The reversed arm is what makes the parallel arm mean something
//!
//! A parallel run *probably* assigns ids in a different order, but "probably" is not a
//! test: eight threads might interleave neatly and prove nothing. Reversing the emission
//! order makes different ids **certain** and deterministic — the last fact is created
//! first — so the reversed arm is what demonstrates that identity ignores id assignment,
//! and the parallel arm then only has to agree with it.
