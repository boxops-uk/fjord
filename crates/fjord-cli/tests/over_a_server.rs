//! **The phase's command sequence, against a running server.**
//!
//! `tests/cli.rs` drives the same commands with nothing listening, and the two files
//! together are the claim: a lifecycle command works the same either way, and which
//! way it went is a property of the *address* rather than of the command.
//!
//! What makes this test prove routing rather than assume it is the counterfactual next
//! door. A running server holds the root lock (`ops-I1`), so a command that opened the
//! directory in this process **could not succeed** — `a_held_store_root_refuses_lifecycle_commands`
//! is that exact situation, and it fails by name. So every success below is a frame
//! that crossed the socket.
