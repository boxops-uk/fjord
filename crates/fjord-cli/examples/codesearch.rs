//! **The traffic a code-search UI actually makes**: search by name, paged, never unbounded.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --example codesearch -- --data-dir /path/to/db --users 256
//! cargo run --release --example codesearch -- --data-dir … --page 100 --think-ms 2000
//! ```
//!
//! `soak` measures a deliberately lopsided *generic* population — most queries cheap, one
//! in a hundred asking for the whole database — because that shape is what finds
//! head-of-line blocking. This one measures a **product**, and the two disagree about
//! almost everything that matters:
//!
//! | | `soak` | here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the expensive class | a whole-database join, 1% of queries, 94% of the CPU | there isn't one |
//! | how a query ends | drained to the last row | **paged**: take 50, cancel the rest |
//! | what it searches for | one pivot, every time | a **pool of real names**, prefix-truncated |
//! | an empty search term | — | **never issued**: no prefix, no query |
//!
//! Each of those changes the answer, and the last one is a product decision rather than a
//! measurement choice: a UI that refuses to search for nothing never asks this database for
//! an unbounded scan, which is what makes the numbers below look nothing like `soak`'s.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Every query is a prefix seek into `src.SearchByName`, whose key leads with `name`
//! precisely so that this is a range rather than a filter (`sample_schema.rs` says as much).
//! Terms are **sampled from the corpus** and truncated, so a search-as-you-type burst is
//! short prefixes matching thousands and a considered search is a long one matching a few —
//! which is the selectivity spread a real population has and a single pivot cannot show.
//!
//! Results are **paged**: the client takes `--page` rows and cancels the rest, which is
//! what a UI backend does when it renders fifty hits.
//!
//! It is worth knowing what that costs, because the obvious guess is wrong. The executor
//! computes a whole `CHUNK_ROWS = 256` chunk whatever the page size, so a 50-row page looks
//! like it should be free next to a 256-row one — and it is not. Measured at 32 users:
//!
//! ```text
//!   page  rows returned  typeahead p50  achieved
//!     50             48         6.1 ms  5,118 q/s
//!    100             93         7.1 ms  4,489 q/s
//!    256            226        10.5 ms  3,274 q/s
//!    500            417        14.4 ms  2,508 q/s
//! ```
//!
//! Roughly linear in rows *delivered*, because the per-row cost that dominates is not the
//! executor's — it is one frame each through the outbound mutex, the socket and the client's
//! decoder ([findings §9](../../../bench/FINDINGS.md)), and a cancel stops paying it. Bigger pages
//! are cheaper per row (245k row/s at page 50, 1.05M at page 500) and dearer per query, so
//! the page size is a latency/throughput dial rather than a free choice.
//!
//! # What is deliberately missing
//!
//! **Find-references**, and it is missing for a reason that has since been removed. It is
//! the second thing anyone wants from a code-search tool, and when this mix was written it
//! could not be served at all: `src.Ref` was keyed `{at, file, to}`, so a lookup by `to`
//! could not seek and scanned all 4,879,151 references — 2.21 s for a *single* declaration,
//! multiplied by every declaration sharing the name. Including it would have made this a
//! benchmark of one unanswerable query.
//!
//! The key is `{to, file, at}` now (`bench/FINDINGS.md` §2), so the query compiles to a
//! seek and belongs in this mix. Adding it needs a re-indexed corpus to measure against,
//! which is hours of indexing and has not been done — so it is named here as the next
//! thing this workload owes rather than quietly left out.
