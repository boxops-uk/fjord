//! **The write rung** — the one instrument in this project that
//! measures a database being *written* rather than read.
//!
//! Every rung S1–S7 measures reading, against a sealed corpus. That left the one number
//! the write path is judged by — facts per second — attributable to nothing:
//! [findings §12](../../../bench/FINDINGS.md) had to be read off the .NET indexer's own report,
//! which bundles Roslyn, a socket, the server's framing and the funnel into one figure.
//! This separates them, in process, with no tokio and no wire.
//!
//! # The ladder, and what each rung subtracts
//!
//! | layer | resolves | reads the LSM | commits | decodes |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `commit` | no | no | yes | no |
//! | `intern` → `dedup:warm` | yes | **no** — every key is cached | no | no |
//! | `intern` → `dedup:cold` | yes | yes | no | no |
//! | `intern` → `create` | yes | yes | yes | no |
//! | `block` | yes | yes | yes | **yes** |
//!
//! Read the differences rather than the rows:
//!
//! - `create` − `dedup:cold` is what **committing** costs inside interning, which is the
//!   term [12f](../../../PLAN.md) proposes to cut by batching per block instead of per fact.
//! - `dedup:cold` − `dedup:warm` is what the **cache removes** — the same claim
//!   `interning_reads_a_key_once_however_many_references_name_it` makes as a count, priced.
//! - `block` − `create` is the transport codec, which is the only part of the write path
//!   the read ladder already had an opinion about.
//!
//! # Why a write bench needs a database per iteration
//!
//! Ingest is not idempotent in the way a query is: the second run of the same facts
//! creates nothing. So an iteration cannot re-run against its own output, and every timed
//! run gets a fresh directory. Two consequences worth stating because they are easy to
//! get wrong and invisible when you do:
//!
//! - **Keyspace creation is excluded.** A pair of trees costs ~30 ms and the source layer
//!   needs four pairs, so lazily creating them inside the timed region would put ~120 ms
//!   of setup into a one-second measurement. [`FjallDb::create_predicates`] exists for
//!   this and is called before the clock starts.
//! - **The counts are checked against a closed form, not against the previous run.**
//!   [`Corpus`] states what it costs ([`Corpus::facts`], [`Corpus::interns`]) and a test
//!   proves that statement against a real store, so a run that writes a different number
//!   of facts aborts — including the first one, which a probe-and-hold discipline cannot
//!   check.
