//! **The bottom of the [capacity ladder](../../../bench/FINDINGS.md): the executor,
//! the compiler and the store, each measured alone.**
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --example engine -- --store /path/to/db/<name>/<ulid>
//! cargo run --release --example engine -- --store … --layer store
//! cargo run --release --example engine -- --store … --only scan --iterations 5
//! ```
//!
//! `loadgen` measures the whole round trip and `breakdown` takes its fixed cost apart.
//! Both stop at the socket. This one starts under it: an in-process [`FjallDb`], a plan
//! compiled once *outside* the loop, and [`Executor::enumerate_profiled`] driven
//! directly — no tokio, no wire, no session, no server. Whatever it reports is the
//! floor everything above it is paying on top of.
//!
//! # It runs against a real index, and that is the point
//!
//! `--store` names a **fjall instance directory** — the ULID under a database, the
//! thing that actually holds `keyspaces/`. Point it at a `.NET` checkout indexed by
//! `clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Indexer`, because uniform synthetic rows flatter seeks and
//! understate cache pressure, and because the question this ladder exists to answer is
//! about a corpus somebody would really keep.
//!
//! **The server must not be holding that directory** — fjall takes its own lock, and
//! `ops-I1` means one process owns a root. Copy the instance directory and point at the
//! copy; a copy taken while a server is up is torn, so stop it for the copy.
//!
//! # Every number is checked against what it claims to have measured
//!
//! A throughput figure for a query that did something other than what you think it did
//! is worse than no figure. So each workload is run once **unmeasured** to establish
//! its row count and its per-step examined counts, and every timed run afterwards must
//! reproduce both exactly — a mismatch aborts with the discrepancy rather than printing
//! a rate. That is [`website/content/testing.md`][testing]'s rule about vacuous passes, applied to
//! a measurement instead of an assertion, and it is why the catalogue leads with a
//! query that examines exactly zero rows: an instrument that reports no work for a real
//! query is broken, not fast.
//!
//! Pivots — the file path a seek seeks, the name `SearchByName` searches for — are
//! **sampled from the store**, never computed. `loadgen` can say `files / 2` because it
//! wrote the corpus itself. Against somebody's checkout there is no such arithmetic,
//! and a seek for a key that is not there measures a miss.
//!
//! # Read the shapes, not the microseconds
//!
//! Same caveat as `breakdown`: absolute numbers belong to the box that produced them.
//! What travels is ns/row against predicate size, the ratio between examined and
//! produced, and what paging costs as a fraction of the run it interrupts.
//!
