//! Hand-built fixtures shared by the executor batteries — key-field encoders, an
//! interner builder, and a plan runner.
//!
//! Test machinery, not a product backend. Lives in a support module so tests
//! import these rather than redefining helpers inline (see `website/content/testing.md`).

// The store-shaped half of this toolbox — the probes, the model stores and the
// value helpers — lives in `fjord-store`, because a probe has to be the same
// `FactStore` as the store it is probing. Re-exported here so a battery has one
// place to import from.
