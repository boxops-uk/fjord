//! The compilation driver: one context the phases run through.
//!
//! Before this, `parse`, `lower` and `ty::check` were three functions a caller
//! sequenced by hand, each needing the schema and an interner threaded to it and
//! each handing back diagnostics to be collected. Every caller wrote the same
//! fifteen lines, and each was free to write them differently — `src/main.rs`
//! stopped after a parse error, `sigla::corpus` carried on.
//!
//! [`Compilation`] owns that plumbing instead: the source, the schema, the
//! per-query interner, the diagnostics sink, and the trees and side tables the
//! phases produce ([chapter 7]). Flatten is another pass over the
//! same state rather than a fourth function with a fourth `Vec`.
//!
//! **Deliberately not a query engine.** No memoization, no dependency graph, no
//! incremental recomputation — a compilation is one query, compiled once, and
//! designing for incrementality before anything needs it would buy a rewrite
//! later.
//!
//! # What it does not store
//!
//! The **CST**. It borrows the source, and holding it here would make this a
//! self-referential struct for the sake of a tree that lowering consumes and
//! nothing reads again. `Ast` and `Typed` are owned outright, so the context is a
//! plain struct parameterised by the source's lifetime.
