//! The **CST façade** — an untyped, lossless, grammar-shaped view of a parse.
//!
//! This is the first of the three tree representations ([chapter 7]). Its job is
//! *fidelity*: every node carries its span and the source text it covers, so
//! diagnostics can point at exactly the right bytes and a parse round-trips back
//! to text. It is deliberately **permissive** — it happily represents constructs
//! that are meaningless, which are rejected later at typecheck/flatten with a
//! clear diagnostic rather than contorted into the grammar.
//!
//! The generated parser produces a flat, index-addressed [`Cst`]. This module
//! wraps it as a recursive tree with two folds — [`CstNode::cata`] (bottom-up)
//! and [`CstNode::para`] (bottom-up, keeping the node beside each result) — which
//! is what lowering runs on.
//!
