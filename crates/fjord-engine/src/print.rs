//! [`Ast`] → text, in two renderings that must not be confused.
//!
//! - [`print`] emits **sigla source**: text that parses and lowers back to the tree
//!   it came from. That makes lowering invertible, which is what lets the front end
//!   be property-tested — generate a tree, print it, parse it, compare — rather than
//!   only checked against hand-written snippets.
//! - [`canonical`] emits an **s-expression**, which is deliberately *not* sigla
//!   syntax. It is the structural identity of a tree: two trees built by different
//!   routes have different `NodeId`s and different spans but the same canonical
//!   form, so this is what a round-trip compares. Keeping it a separate rendering is
//!   what stops the round-trip property being circular.
//!
//! Printing is **not** the inverse of parsing in the other direction: whitespace,
//! redundant parens and the choice of string escapes are all lost. Only
//! `parse ∘ print == id` on trees is claimed, and only that is tested.
//!
//! The hard part is parentheses. The grammar has three precedence levels, and a
//! child looser than its position allows has to be wrapped — see [`Prec`].
