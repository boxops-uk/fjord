//! flatten — the typed query becomes the [`Plan`] the executor runs.
//!
//! The last front-end phase and the one the two halves of the system meet at
//! ([chapter 7]). It takes the typed tree and produces an ordered `[Level]`
//! plus a `head: Project`, which is the fixed contract
//! ([chapter 4](../../../website/content/executor.md)); everything after this point is the
//! executor's.
//!
//! Four things happen here, in this order, and the order is the design:
//!
//! 1. **Collect** the statements. A statement is a fact pattern — `test.Foo {…}`,
//!    optionally bound to a variable by `X = test.Foo {…}` — and each becomes one
//!    loop level holding one register. A fact pattern written *inside* another is a
//!    generator too, and is **hoisted** into a level of its own, bound to a name the
//!    query did not write; everything after this point sees an ordinary row bind.
//!    Two kinds of statement iterate nothing and are settled here: a **substitution**
//!    (a folded constant, or an alias naming a place) and a **constraint** — `X =
//!    "a"..`, a pattern the value wherever `X` lives has to match.
//! 2. **Safety.** Every variable a seek, residual or the head *reads* must be
//!    **captured** by some generator's key pattern. That is the whole of what
//!    correctness needs — see [`reorder`](crate::reorder) for why it is not
//!    an ordering problem — and a query with an uncaptured variable is rejected
//!    (`reject/unbound-variable`), not answered.
//! 3. **Reorder**, over the dependency graph collect built: any order that binds
//!    before it reads gives the same answer, so which one is a performance choice
//!    among the safe ones rather than a correctness question.
//! 4. **Sargeability**, walking each level's key fields *in the chosen order* and
//!    deciding, per field, whether it narrows the scan (a **seek**), is filled from
//!    a register bound at an outer level (a **splice**), or filters rows as they
//!    come (a **residual**). This is order-dependent — a variable being captured
//!    cannot seek, because it is an output, unless a constraint says what the output
//!    has to look like — which is why it runs after the order is fixed rather than
//!    before.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **Read through a reference held in a fact's *value*.** Following a reference is a
//! compare ([`SeekKeyPart::RegisterFactId`], no store read) and reading through one
//! is a [`Source::Fetch`] level, so both halves work — but a fetch reads the id out
//! of a register's *key* bytes, and a value is in the other column family
//! (`nyi/fact-field`).
//!
//! **Bind a value that is in no register.** `X = {a = 1, b = Y}` mentions a captured
//! variable, so it differs per row and would have to be *built*. That is a derived
//! bind ([`Step::Derive`]), and nothing in sigla lowers one yet (`nyi/value-bind`).
//! A constant folds and a field read is an alias; neither is this.
//!
//! **Match on a value.** A value lives in `entities`, and [I6] keeps `entities`
//! out of the scan loop, so `.value` may be projected but not matched
//! (`nyi/value-match`).
//!
//! **Match a whole key into a record field.** A stored key is its fields back to
//! back with no wrapper ([chapter 3]) and a record *field* keeps its wrapper, so the
//! same record is not the same bytes (`nyi/whole-key`). Binding a whole key works —
//! it decomposes into the per-field questions.
//!
//! **Push a pattern into something that is not a target.** `test.Foo {…} = test.Bar
//! {…}` and `Y.name = X` have no variable to bind, so they are not binds at all
//! (`nyi/bind-unification`), and a variable at two key fields of one row needs a
//! same-row residual the executor has no operator for (`nyi/repeated-variable`).
//!
//! Each of those is a corpus entry, so the promise is checked rather than
//! described ([`corpus`](crate::corpus)).

/// The executor's generator ([`plan::proptest`](crate::plan::proptest))
/// draws a *plan* directly, which tests the machine but not the compiler. This one
/// draws a **query, in sigla text**, together with a store it runs against and an
/// **independent model** of what it means — so the property is "compiling and
/// running this query gives the rows the query denotes", with the model as the
/// oracle ([testing](../../../website/content/testing.md), tier 3).
///
/// Valid by construction, in the same style: draw a schema (predicates × key field
/// types) → draw conforming facts → draw statements over that schema whose every
/// variable occurs in a *capturable* position. Two consequences are what make the
/// battery worth running:
///
/// - **Range restriction is automatic**, so the generator never has to guess
///   whether a query should compile: every draw must.
/// - **Every permutation of the body is a valid order**, because a variable only
///   ever appears in a key field, where whichever statement runs first captures it.
///   That is what lets the reorderability property enumerate *all* orders rather
///   than only the ones some analysis says are safe.
///
/// # What each construct is here to reach
///
/// The generator's job is to make flatten emit every shape a `Plan` can hold — the
/// census (`the_generator_reaches_every_plan_shape`) is what says it does, and each
/// of these was added because the census failed without it:
///
/// | construct drawn | plan shape it produces |
/// |---|---|
/// | a constant in the leading key field | `SeekKey::Prefix(non-empty)` |
/// | a bound variable, then anything determined | a composite seek of several parts |
/// | a string prefix (`"a"..`) behind an open field | `ResidualOp::Prefix` |
/// | a **record-typed** key field given sub-field by sub-field | nested `FieldPath`s |
/// | three-field keys | more than one residual on a level |
/// | a **row bind** (`R0 = gen.P0 {…}`) | `Project::FactRef`, and a register a head reads through |
/// | a predicate with a **value** | `Project::Value` — a point read at projection |
/// | a **negation** over a captured variable | a `Step::Test`, and a probe that seeks or filters |
/// | a **second branch** on a statement | a level with two `Source`s — and, on a negation, a test with two |
///
/// The last two also carry the **algebraic laws**, which are the properties that use
/// no model at all: a negation and its assertion partition the rows, a disjunction is
/// the concatenation of its branches, and `!(A | B)` is `!A; !B`. Each is
/// `prop_filter`ed onto the draws that can carry it, which costs a redraw rather than
/// a weaker generator.
