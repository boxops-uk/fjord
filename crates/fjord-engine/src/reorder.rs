//! reorder — choose the loop order. **The runnable frontier, greedily.**
//!
//! Ordering a query's generators is *mostly* a performance choice ([chapter 7]),
//! and correctness needs only a **safety** check: every variable a seek, residual
//! or head reads must be *captured* by some generator's key pattern, before it is
//! read. But "before" is a property of the order, so where the order the query was
//! *written* in reads a variable the statement after it binds, this module is what
//! makes the query legal — and the alternative is refusing a query that has a
//! perfectly good plan.
//!
//! So [`reorder`] emits the **frontier**: repeatedly, the statements whose reads
//! are all bound, lowest-numbered first. Greedy, one pass, no backtracking —
//! because the constraint is monotone (see below). A query whose written order
//! already works is returned unchanged, so this is not a second way to compile
//! anything; it is the same plan, plus the orders that would otherwise be refused.
//!
//! # Why greedy is complete
//!
//! `reads` is a *structural* property of a statement — the base of an access chain
//! is read whatever the order — and `bound` only ever grows as statements are
//! emitted. So a statement runnable at one step is still runnable at the next, and
//! emitting one can never strand another: if any valid order exists, taking
//! anything runnable leads to one. No search, no give-up branch.
//!
//! Glean's `Reorder` does need a give-up branch, and the difference is *nested*
//! statement groups (from negation and disjunction), whose own reads depend on how
//! their branches are ordered — which is where monotonicity fails. sigla has none —
//! a negated *group* is still refused by name (`nyi/negation`) — so this argument
//! must be re-proved when one lands, and not before.
//!
//! [`Deps::antichains`] is kept, but off this path: it answers *whether* an order
//! exists (the exact feasibility question, and the property test's independent
//! check), while a layering is the wrong shape to *choose* one — a layer index is
//! only a lower bound on position, so sorting within a layer can never defer a
//! statement past the layer that would have bound its key. See [`reorder`] on
//! where the selectivity heuristic goes.
//!
//! # Why a variable graph, not an edge list
//!
//! The obvious interface is "statement *i* must precede statement *j*". It is the
//! wrong one, because **which statement captures a variable depends on the order
//! chosen**: in `test.Edge {from = X, to = Y}; test.Node {id = Y}` either statement
//! can capture `Y` — whichever comes first — and reversing them is a valid plan
//! with a different seek. An edge list fixes that choice before the order is
//! picked, and so forbids orders that are perfectly correct.
//!
//! [`Deps`] therefore records, per statement, the variables it *can* capture and
//! the ones it can only *read* (the base of an access chain — `Y.name` reads `Y`
//! and can never bind it). Edges fall out of an order rather than constraining it,
//! and a derived bind — which consumes variables and produces one without
//! iterating — is the same shape: reads it cannot satisfy itself, captures it
//! offers. So is a **negation**, at the extreme: it captures nothing at all, so
//! every variable it names is a read, and the placement rule Datalog states
//! separately — a negation runs after everything binding the variables it uses —
//! is what this graph already says about it.
//!
