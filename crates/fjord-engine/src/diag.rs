//! Diagnostics: the codes the front end reports with, and the sink it reports into.
//!
//! Two things live here, and they are the same idea from opposite ends.
//!
//! [`Code`] is the **identity** of a fault, separate from its wording. Tests assert
//! on the code, so a message can be reworded without churning them, and
//! `sigla::corpus` — the language surface as data — classifies every deferred
//! construct by the code it must draw. It is an enum rather than the `&'static str`
//! it started as because a typo in a string is a test that passes for the wrong
//! reason; the compiler now enumerates the taxonomy. The rendered form is
//! unchanged, so what a reader sees is what it always was.
//!
//! [`Diagnostics`] is the **sink**: one per compilation, shared by every phase.
//! Phases report by pushing into it and cannot return diagnostics, which is the
//! point — a `Vec` handed back is a `Vec` a caller can drop on the floor, and
//! "every diagnostic reaches the user" then rests on each call site remembering.
//! The same move as [`Executor::enumerate`](crate::iter::Executor) taking
//! `self` to make [I8](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i8) structural.
