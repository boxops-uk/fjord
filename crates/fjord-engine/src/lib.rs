//! **sigla** — the query language — and the machine that runs it.
//!
//! Two halves meeting at one fixed contract, the [`Plan`](plan::Plan) IR:
//! `lex → parse → typecheck → flatten → reorder` compiles sigla text to a plan,
//! and [`iter`] runs that plan as a nested loop over a store, able to suspend to
//! a bytes-only cursor and resume exactly.
//!
//! Everything physical is below this crate — the schema, the id, the codec, the
//! store — so what is left here is a description of a query and a machine that
//! executes one. Design of record:
//! [chapter 4](../../../website/content/executor.md) for the machine,
//! [chapter 5](../../../website/content/executor.md) for resume, and
//! [chapter 7](../../../website/content/query-language.md) for the compiler.
