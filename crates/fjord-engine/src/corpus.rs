//! The **target-feature corpus** — the language surface as an executable audit table.
//!
//! The grammar parses the *full* intended feature surface, so that
//! new work adds meaning to constructs that already parse
//! rather than reshaping the grammar ([chapter 7]). That claim needs a written
//! target, and a written target in prose drifts — so the table lives here, as
//! data, next to the tests that check it.
//!
//! Each entry says what the compiler must do with a snippet:
//!
//! | Classification | Meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Expectation::Supported`] | parses, typechecks, is implemented, and **returns these rows** against the shared [`fixture`](fjord_store::fixture) |
//! | [`Expectation::Diagnosed`] | parses, then draws **one specific diagnostic code** — either "not yet implemented" or a rejection of something meaningless |
//! | [`Expectation::ParseError`] | not sigla at all; a parse diagnostic is the correct answer |
//!
//! The headline acceptance gate for the phase is that **no entry panics and no
//! `Diagnosed` entry is a parse error** — an unimplemented feature must be
//! reported by name, not by a syntax error.
//!
//! # The audit: what parses, and what each construct means
//!
//! | Construct | Before | Now |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `pattern where stmt; stmt`, `_`, vars, `Nat`, `-Nat`, `"s"`, `"s"..`, records, nesting | parses | unchanged |
//! | `QId pattern` fact pattern | parses; key **mandatory** | unchanged — a whole-predicate scan is `test.Foo _` |
//! | `p.lid` access chain | parses | plus `.value`, the fact's value side |
//! | `p = p` bind | parses | unchanged; the hard cases are rejected at typecheck |
//! | `( p )` group, `( p where … )` subquery | **no paren token at all** | added |
//! | union select `p.alt?` | not representable | added |
//! | disjunction `p \| p` | not representable | added, flat n-ary |
//! | negation `!` | not representable | added, statement prefix |
//! | `never` | not representable | added |
//! | `1__0`, `1_`, `007`, overflow | lexed silently | lexed permissively, rejected in lowering by code |
//! | string escapes | lexed, never decoded | decoded in lowering |
//!
//! # What the grammar has grown since
//!
//! One token: **`!=`**, a *denial*
//! ([chapter 7](../../../website/content/query-language.md#denying-a-value)). The audit above was written
//! to make later work add *meaning* to constructs that already parse, and this is the one
//! thing since that did not already parse — worth recording rather than folding into the table,
//! because the table is what the original audit found and this is a later addition to it.
//!
//! It is not a case the audit missed so much as one it could not have placed: `!` was listed as
//! negation and `!=` reads like its infix relative, but they are different questions — "no such
//! row exists" against "this row's field does not look like that" — and only the second is a
//! residual. Nothing else about the grammar moved.
//!
//! # The database these entries run against
//!
//! The shared [`fixture`](fjord_store::fixture) — its schema, its facts, and the
//! same rows the shell serves, so a corpus entry is something a person can type at
//! the prompt. Every `Supported` entry records what it returns, and the gate below
//! runs it against a **real** `FjallDb` to check.
//!
