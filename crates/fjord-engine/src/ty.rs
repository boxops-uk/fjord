//! Typecheck — resolve names against the schema and **annotate, don't mutate**.
//!
//! Types go into a side table indexed by [`NodeId`], never into the tree
//! ([chapter 7]): the tree stays the shared substrate and each phase owns its own
//! annotations. Because the store is append-only and its ids dense, that table is a
//! `Vec`, not a map.
//!
//! This is also where the permissive grammar is narrowed. Every construct the
//! grammar accepts but the engine cannot yet run draws **one specific diagnostic
//! naming it**, rather than a parse error or a confusing type error — that promise
//! is what [`corpus`](crate::corpus) exists to check. Two kinds of narrowing
//! happen here:
//!
//! - **`nyi/…`** — deferred features: disjunction, negation, subqueries, union
//!   select, `never`, and the hard half of `pattern = pattern`
//!   ([open decisions](../../../PLAN.md)).
//! - **`reject/…`** — constructs that are meaningless and will not be implemented:
//!   a wildcard head, a literal as a bind target, `.value` where the key shadows it
//!   ([conventions](../../../AGENTS.md)).
//!
//! Inference is Hindley–Milner-shaped — unification over type variables with an
//! occurs check — ported from the superseded `lens` prototype, with records as
//! sorted slices rather than a `HashMap`. Errors accumulate: a failed unification
//! rolls its substitution back so a mistake in one field cannot poison its
//! siblings, and checking continues.
