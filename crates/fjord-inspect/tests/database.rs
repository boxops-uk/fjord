//! The database table, and the ranges a run walks across it.
//!
//! The table's whole claim is that it shows *the rows the machine will walk, in
//! the order it will meet them* — so a scan's `[lo, hi)` is a band across it.
//! If the order were the insertion order, or the bytes were rendered with
//! separators, or a range were reported after the rows it produced, the band
//! would point at the wrong rows and every screenshot would still look
//! plausible.
