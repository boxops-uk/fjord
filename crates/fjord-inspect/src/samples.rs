//! What the interactive site opens with: a schema, and queries over it.
//!
//! **Here rather than in the page, because here they are tested.** The first
//! version of the site invented its own sample queries in TypeScript, and every
//! one of them was missing the head a query requires — the lexer tokenised them
//! happily and nobody noticed until a parser was wired up. A sample that ships
//! is a claim about the language, so it is data in a crate with a suite, and
//! `every_sample_compiles_clean` is the claim.
//!
//! The schema is [`schemas/demo.sigla`](crate::demo) — the site's own, small
//! enough to read in a screen and chosen so every shape the language has
//! appears exactly once. `code.sigla` is the real one and cannot do this job:
//! it has no union and no nested record, so a select, a union pattern and a
//! discriminant residual would have nothing to bind against.

/// A query worth opening with, what it is an example of, and how many rows it
/// answers.
///
/// The count is part of the sample rather than a fact about it: a demo query
/// that answers nothing demonstrates nothing, and one that answers a single row
/// shows no backtracking. `every_sample_answers_what_it_says` holds each to its
/// number.
pub struct Sample {
    pub label: &'static str,
    pub source: &'static str,

    /// `None` when the sample is there to be refused.

}

/// The queries the site opens with, in the order a reader should meet them.
///
/// Between them they reach every construct the language has: a scan and a seek,
/// a join through a reference in both key positions, a record head, a
/// constraint, a fuzzy match, a comparison, arithmetic, a denial, a negation, a
/// disjunction, a subquery, a nested record, a union matched as a seek and the
/// same union matched as a residual, a select, and the value side.
///
/// The fuzzy sample is on `code.File` rather than on a declaration's name, and
/// that is what it is for: `File`'s key *is* the string, so the pattern reaches
/// the key order and the plan is a **guided** access. Behind `Decl`'s leading
/// reference the same pattern is a residual — the same question, a different
/// plan, one edit away in the box.
