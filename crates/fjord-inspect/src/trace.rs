//! **The run, one transition at a time** — the whole of it, in one answer.
//!
//! The executor is a defunctionalised state machine
//! ([I7](../../../web/src/content/invariants.mdx#i7)): `depth`, a stack of
//! frames, and a loop whose every iteration is exactly one transition. So a
//! debugger is not a second interpreter — it is that loop, driven a step at a
//! time, with the machine's own state read between steps.
//! `stepping_yields_what_running_yields` is what says the two are the same
//! machine.
//!
//! **The whole trace, not a step at a time.** A page that asked for step *n*
//! would replay the prefix for each one, which is O(n²) for a scrub bar; and a
//! live executor across the WebAssembly boundary would put state — and a
//! `free()` — where two strings and JSON have been enough. So one call runs the
//! query to the end and answers every step, each carrying **what changed**: the
//! registers written, the row yielded, the row dropped and which residual
//! dropped it. The page folds those into cumulative state and scrubs a local
//! array, forwards and backwards, without asking again.
//!
//! **The cap is stated, never silent.** Past [`TRACE_CAP`] transitions the run
//! stops and says so, because a truncated run rendered as a whole one is the
//! failure worth guarding against.
