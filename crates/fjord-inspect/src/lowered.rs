//! The **lowered tree** and the types typecheck gave it.
//!
//! Where the parse tree is grammar-shaped and knows nothing, this one is what
//! the later phases actually run on: names resolved against a schema, records
//! sorted by field name, `.value` distinguished from a key field, and every node
//! carrying whatever type inference reached for it.
//!
//! **Two things a browser has to be told, because a `NodeId` cannot carry
//! them.** A `Symbol` is an index into the interner that minted it and means
//! nothing without it, so every name here is resolved to text at the boundary —
//! `every_symbol_in_a_view_is_resolved_to_text` is the guard, and the failure it
//! catches is a view that prints `?` where a variable's name should be. And a
//! `Ty` is rendered here rather than by the engine, because the engine's own
//! rendering is prose for a diagnostic ("an integer", "(already reported)")
//! while a panel wants the notation a schema is written in.
//!
//! The statements are listed beside the tree rather than in it: a query's body
//! is a `[QueryStmt]`, not an expression, and flattening it into the node arena
//! would invent a parent the engine does not have.
