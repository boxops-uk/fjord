//! The parse, as data: the **lossless, untyped, grammar-shaped tree** the book's
//! phase table promises, with every node's span.
//!
//! This is the tree the parser actually produces — grammar rules and token
//! leaves — not the lowered one. Two things follow from that, and both are why
//! it is worth showing:
//!
//! - **It is permissive.** The grammar accepts constructs that mean nothing, and
//!   they are refused later by name at typecheck or flatten. A reader sees the
//!   shape before anything has judged it.
//! - **It needs no schema.** Lowering resolves names against one; parsing does
//!   not, so a browser can show this for any text at all, including text that is
//!   half-typed.
//!
//! Every node carries its span, so a page can highlight both ways: source to
//! node, and node to source.
//!
//! **Two properties a page leans on, and both are asserted.** The leaves
//! reassemble the source exactly — the grammar's `skip Whitespace` keeps trivia
//! out of the parser's *matching*, not out of the tree — and a node's span
//! contains every child's. A view that quietly widened a span would still look
//! plausible in a tree and would highlight the wrong bytes; `tree_spans_nest`
//! is what catches it.
