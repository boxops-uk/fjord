//! One definition each, because a page keys on these field names and a second
//! `Span` shape — even an identical one — is a second thing to keep true. The
//! diagnostic view is deliberately flat: a code, a message, and the spans it
//! points at, with the primary one marked. Everything a terminal renders around
//! that (the gutter, the underline, the snippet) is the page's business.
