//! The **plan** — what the query actually does, and in what order.
//!
//! This is the argument for the whole exercise. A reader who has seen the tokens
//! and the tree has seen the query restated; the plan is where the compiler's
//! decisions become visible: which predicate is scanned first, what the seek key
//! pins, which comparisons narrowed a scan and which are filtering rows that had
//! to be read anyway.
//!
//! **The text of each step is the engine's own** — [`print::steps`](fjord_engine::print::steps), the same
//! renderer `fjord query --plan` shows. That is deliberate: a second rendering
//! would decode stored bytes a second way, and the places it would differ are
//! exactly the ones worth reading (a constant's type, a union alternative's
//! name, which field a path names). What this view adds is *structure* around
//! that text — the step's kind, the register it fills, the predicates it reads —
//! so a page can address a step rather than parse a line.
//!
//! **Levels are not steps, and the distinction is load-bearing.** A cursor holds
//! one row per *level*, a derive and a test bind nothing, and `Plan::levels` is
//! not `body.len()` — so both counts are carried, named apart.
