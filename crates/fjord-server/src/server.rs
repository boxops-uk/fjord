//! The Unix socket listener.
//!
//! **Unix socket only, and that is `ops-I10` rather than a shortcut.** The design is
//! default-closed: TCP is an explicit opt-in the operator puts behind an
//! authenticated gateway, and a server that binds a network interface because nobody
//! said not to is the failure that rule exists to prevent. Adding the opt-in is a
//! second listener and a flag; leaving it out is the safe default, not an omission to
//! be tidied up later.
//!
//! # Binding is synchronous, accepting is not
//!
//! [`Listener::bind`] takes the socket with `std` and only converts to tokio's inside
//! [`run`](Listener::run). That is not fussiness: `tokio::net::UnixListener::bind`
//! requires a runtime context, so binding there would mean a caller could not find out
//! whether the socket was available until it had already started a runtime — and the
//! *readiness file* has to be written after a successful bind and before anything
//! connects, which is much easier to get right when binding is an ordinary fallible
//! call.
//!
//! One task per connection, spawned onto the runtime. The blocking half of a
//! connection's work — every fjall read and write — goes to
//! [`spawn_blocking`](tokio::task::spawn_blocking) from inside
//! [`session`](crate::session), so a task here is doing framing and nothing else.
