//! Turning a query result into rows on the wire.
//!
//! Three small conversions, and the point of splitting them that way is that **no new
//! encoder appears here**. A row goes out through exactly the codec a fact's key
//! comes in through:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Ty            the head's inferred type      (engine)
//!    │  desc_of
//!    ▼
//!   Desc          names resolved, sent once     (wire)
//!    │  to_ty     interned back into the *compilation's* interner
//!    ▼
//!   PredicateTy   what the value codec drives on
//!    │  to_wire   + the row's stored Value
//!    ▼
//!   WireValue  ──encode_value──▶  bytes
//! ```
//!
//! **One interner runs the whole chain**, and it has to be the compilation's: a
//! `Plan`'s projections hold symbols minted there, so a row decodes against it, and
//! the row type is interned back into it so the match below is between names that came
//! from one place. A second interner built from the same schema agrees about schema
//! names and disagrees about every head field name.
//!
//! The temptation is to write a fourth encoder straight from `Desc` and a stored
//! `Value`, which is about twenty-five lines and would be a second definition of the
//! wire format. Going the long way round keeps one.
