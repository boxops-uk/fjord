//! **What the server is doing, counted — and nothing else.**
//!
//! There is deliberately no exporter, no endpoint, no stats file and no format. That is
//! not an omission to be filled in later by whoever needs a number: exposing this is a
//! *separate* decision with an operational cost, and the counters are worth having
//! before it is made. A `/metrics` listener would be a second port on a server whose
//! [`ops-I10`](../../../website/content/operations.md) safety argument rests on binding
//! being default-closed, and the durable home the design already names is a virtual
//! predicate over the socket that exists. Either is an adapter over what is here.
//!
//! So what this module owes is that the *counting* be right, because a counter that
//! drifts is worse than none — it reads as a leak that is not there, or hides one that
//! is.
//!
//! **One set of numbers has since taken the durable home this doc names**, and it is not
//! the server's own: [`InterningCounters`] carries what the *store* counted on the write
//! path, and `fjord.db.Interning` answers it as a virtual predicate over the socket
//! that already exists — the same arrangement `fjord.db.List` has. What forced the
//! question was a measurement it could not answer: `bench/FINDINGS.md` §15 priced our
//! interning at four times Glean's and could not say whether the lookup cache was even
//! hitting, because the counters that would say were reachable only from a debugger. The
//! counters below are still unexposed, and deliberately: a connection count is not what
//! anybody needed.
//!
//! # Gauges are guards, not increments
//!
//! Two of these go up and down, and both count things that end on many paths — a task
//! that returns, fails, is cancelled, or is dropped mid-await. A matched
//! `fetch_add`/`fetch_sub` pair written at what look like the entry and the exit is
//! wrong the first time somebody adds a `?`. [`Live`] decrements on `Drop`, so the
//! count is right on every path there is, including the ones nobody thought of.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical worry here. The bug these were built for
//! (`bench/FINDINGS.md` §10) was precisely a task that never reached its exit.
//!
//! # Relaxed, and why that is enough
//!
//! Every counter is [`Ordering::Relaxed`]. Nothing branches on these values — they are
//! read by tests and, eventually, by whatever reports them — so there is nothing for a
//! stronger ordering to protect. What relaxed does *not* give is a consistent snapshot
//! across counters, which is why a reader should treat two of them as two facts rather
//! than as a ratio taken at one instant.
