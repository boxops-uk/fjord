//! **`fjord.db.List` and `fjord.db.Interning` — the server, answered as facts.**
//!
//! [Operations §5](../../../website/content/operations.md) asks for enumeration to ride
//! the query machinery rather than a control message, and this is that: `\l` is a query,
//! with a plan, a seek, residuals, a profile and a resume cursor, exactly as a query over
//! `src.File` is. What it buys is not tidiness — it is that filtering, joining and paging
//! all work the first time somebody wants them, instead of being three features a bespoke
//! `LIST` frame would have to grow one at a time.
//!
//! # Where this sits, and why it is not a new kind of `Source`
//!
//! The obvious place to put a virtual predicate is the executor: a `Source::Virtual`
//! beside `Seek` and `Fetch`. It is the wrong place, and the reason is the shape of the
//! seam that already exists. [`FactStore`] is *the* answer to "where do rows come from" —
//! two methods, `scan` and `point` — and the executor is generic over it. Answering a
//! predicate from memory is a different answer to that same question, not a different
//! question.
//!
//! Putting it here rather than in the machine means the plan IR gains no variant, the
//! resume cursor gains no case, [`enumerate`](fjord_engine::iter) is not touched, and
//! [I4](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i4) needs no re-proving — the resume battery is
//! already written over an arbitrary `FactStore`, so a store that happens to hold its
//! rows in a `Vec` is a store it already covers. Against that, the IR does not *name*
//! virtual sources, so `:plan` shows a scan of predicate 22 and says nothing about where
//! its rows live. That is the trade, and it is the one the house rules ask for: do not
//! reshape the machine for an additive feature.
//!
//! # What makes the rows indistinguishable from stored ones
//!
//! Everything downstream — registers, residuals, field offsets, projections, the cursor
//! — reads *bytes*. So the listing is encoded through [`fjord_store::fact::encode`],
//! the same function a hand-written deriver writes a fact with, and each row is
//! `predicate_id ++ key`, byte for byte what a scan of a real keyspace produces. Sorted
//! by those bytes, which is the order a keyspace would have held them in, because the
//! codec is order-preserving ([I1](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i1)). Nothing above this
//! module can tell the difference, which is the point: a virtual predicate that needed
//! special handling anywhere else would not be worth having.
//!
//! # Two predicates, one wrapper
//!
//! `fjord.db.List` is what the store root holds; `fjord.db.Interning` is what the
//! write path has done to it since this server opened it (`bench/FINDINGS.md` §15 is why
//! the second exists — it priced our interning and could not say whether the cache was
//! hitting). They are different questions with the same *answer shape*: a tuple this
//! module knows how to encode, in key order, that nothing downstream can tell from a
//! keyspace. So the wrapper holds a [`Table`] per declared predicate and picks by the id
//! leading a scan's `lo`, and adding a third would be a row type and one line here.
//!
//! A schema declaring neither has no catalogue at all, which is every schema but a
//! server's — a client's, a test's, and the copy embedded in a database.
//!
//! # One listing per query, and that is [I8](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i8)'s shape
//!
//! The rows are materialised once, when the query is prepared, and the same `Arc` is
//! shared by every chunk of that query — so a `create` between two pages of `\more` is
//! invisible to the result in flight, exactly as a write to a keyspace is invisible to a
//! snapshot taken before it. Resume then means what it always means: the same data, read
//! from where the cursor says. A *new* query sees a fresh listing, which is the same
//! promise a new snapshot gives.
