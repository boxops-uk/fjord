//! **What the server owns**: a store root, and every database under it.
//!
//! Until 9d the server was handed a `Vec<Arc<Database>>` opened once at startup, and
//! that was the whole reason lifecycle commands had to be refused while it ran: a
//! `create` cannot add to a list nobody holds, and a `remove` cannot delete a directory
//! this process has open. The registry is the mutable form of that list, plus the
//! [`Catalog`] the CLI's offline path already uses — which is what makes
//! [operations §5](../../../website/content/operations.md)'s "two front doors, one
//! implementation" true rather than aspirational. Everything below delegates the actual
//! work to `fjord-store`; what lives here is *when* it is safe to do it.
//!
//! # The two hazards, and where each is answered
//!
//! **A second handle on a store this process already holds.** `ops-I1` gives the server
//! every database under its root, so the offline `finish`'s first act — open the
//! directory — is exactly what the server must not do. It passes the handle it has:
//! [`Catalog::finish_held`].
//!
//! **A database pulled out from under a session.** `remove` closes the store, and a
//! query running against a closed store is a fault the client did not cause. So a
//! database is taken out of the map *first* — no new session can bind it — and removed
//! only if this registry turns out to hold the last reference. If a session still has
//! it, the entry goes back and the request is refused by name, which is what psql does
//! and for the same reason.

/// **A schema belongs to a database, not to a server** ([I13](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i13)):
/// each one embedded its own at create, and this is what reads it back. Exactly one piece
/// is the server's rather than the database's — the **virtual** predicates,
/// `fjord.db.List` and `fjord.db.Interning`, which the server answers out of the root it
/// owns and no artifact holds.
///
/// **There is no fallback, deliberately.** Serving a database that embeds no copy with
/// any schema the server holds is a guess, and a silent one: if that schema has moved
/// since the database was written, its rows decode as something else — the loud version
/// a decode error, the quiet version a query answering zero rows. So a database with no
/// embedded copy is **listed and not served**, which is already how a copy this
/// server cannot *read* is treated, and is the same refusal
/// [I15](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i15) makes of a database carrying no format stamp.
///
/// The virtual half is carried as *source* rather than as a `Schema`, because composing
/// two schemas means composing two interners, and the language already has an operator
/// for it: concatenation. Reserved names sort last
/// ([`RESERVED_NAMESPACE`](fjord_schema::syntax::lower::RESERVED_NAMESPACE)), so
