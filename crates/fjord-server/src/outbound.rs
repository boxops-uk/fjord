//! One connection's outbound side: **a fair writer over per-stream queues**.
//!
//! [Operations §5](../../../web/src/content/operations.mdx) asks for "a per-connection
//! single writer task that fairly interleaves ready streams (round-robin over
//! per-stream output queues)" and gives the reason: *without this, one chatty stream
//! starves the socket even when the executor has capacity*.
//!
//! # Why one queue would not do
//!
//! The obvious implementation is a single channel every stream pushes into, and it is
//! unfair in exactly the way that matters. A query returning a million rows fills the
//! channel; a second stream's four-frame answer queues behind all of them and waits
//! for the first query to finish. The socket was never the bottleneck — the *ordering*
//! was.
//!
//! So each stream has its own bounded queue and the writer takes **one frame from
//! each in turn**. A stream with a million frames gets one slot per rotation, exactly
//! like a stream with four.
//!
//! # Backpressure is what the bound is for
//!
//! A queue is bounded, and a producer that finds its own queue full waits. That is
//! `ops`-level flow control at the only place P0 has any: §5 defers per-stream
//! *windows* and says to start with "bounded per-stream queues + connection
//! backpressure", which is this. A stream that produces faster than the socket drains
//! blocks itself, and no other stream notices.
