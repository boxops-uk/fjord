//! One connection, from handshake to close.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! The frame loop [operations §5 `serve`](../../../website/content/operations.md)
//! describes: a PG-shaped handshake, then framed messages tagged by stream, with a
//! write stream, a query stream and a lifecycle request living on one connection at
//! once — each on its own task, so none of them waits on another.
//!
//! The reader loop never does a stream's work. It reads, routes to that stream's task,
//! and goes back to reading; the one writer task takes a frame from each stream's
//! queue in turn. That is what makes a long query stop starving a short one, and it is
//! why a `create` — tens of keyspaces, tens of milliseconds each — costs the
//! connection's other streams nothing.
//!
//! Still deferred, and named in §5 as deferred: per-stream flow-control windows. What
//! is here instead is bounded per-stream queues plus connection backpressure, which is
//! what §5 says to start with.
//!
//! # Where the blocking work goes, and why that is the whole point of the port
//!
//! **fjall is synchronous and the executor is CPU-bound**, so neither belongs on the
//! reactor: a query that scans a million rows would stall every other connection the
//! thread happened to be driving. Every call that touches a store — ingesting a
//! block, compiling and running a query — is moved to
//! [`spawn_blocking`](tokio::task::spawn_blocking), and what stays here is framing and
//! scheduling.
//!
//! That cut is what 9d-ii builds on. Once the engine is off the reactor, the reactor
//! is free to interleave streams, flush a result in chunks, and notice a cancel — none
//! of which is possible while a query owns the thread that would have to do them.
//!
//! # A write stream is a state, and that is the only state a connection has
//!
//! `OPEN_WRITE` puts a stream id into [`Session::writing`]; `COPY_DATA` on an id that
//! is not there is a protocol fault rather than an implicit open. That matters more
//! than it looks: an implicit open would mean a client that mistyped a stream id
//! silently started a *second* write stream, and the counts it got back would be for
//! a stream it did not think it had.
