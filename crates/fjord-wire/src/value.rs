//! The wire value: what a fact looks like in flight.
//!
//! # Positional, because the schema is already on both ends
//!
//! [`WireValue::Record`] holds a bare slice of values with **no field names**, and
//! that is the central design decision rather than a shortcut. Both peers have the
//! schema — the handshake compares the client's expected schema fingerprint against
//! the DB's before a byte of data flows
//! ([operations §6](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/operations.md#6-wire-protocol--the-write-stream)),
//! and [I13](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i13) freezes a DB's schema at create — so
//! the field names, their order and their types are known to the reader in advance.
//! Sending them again is sending what the reader already has.
//!
//! This is Avro's model, and Avro states the consequence plainly: *"Binary encoded
//! Avro data does not include type information or field names"*, so *"a schema must
//! always be used in order to read Avro data correctly"*, and a record is *"just the
//! concatenation of the encodings of its fields"*. Making the Rust type positional is
//! what stops that being a convention someone can break: there is no field name to
//! put in the wrong order, because there is no field name.
//!
//! **Why not tags, the way Protocol Buffers and Thrift do.** A protobuf field is a
//! tag-value pair, the tag being `(field_number << 3) | wire_type` as a varint —
//! one to two bytes per field per message. What that buys is a reader skipping
//! fields it does not know, which is schema evolution across versions that never
//! agreed. Here the peers *have* agreed, and disagreement is caught at handshake by
//! fingerprint rather than tolerated per field; P0 compatibility is subset
//! containment, so a predicate that exists at all has the shape both ends think it
//! has. Tags would be a per-fact price for a property this connection already has by
//! other means.
//!
//! **Why not a zero-copy layout, the way Cap'n Proto does.** Cap'n Proto's win is
//! O(1) access with no parse step, paid for with fixed-width fields that are larger
//! on the wire than varints. Neither half fits: every inbound fact is decoded
//! anyway — to intern its references and to re-encode it as a storage tuple
//! ([chapter 3](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/storage.md#interning-a-nested-fact)) — so
//! there is no parse to avoid, and the size is worse.
//!
//! # A reference is a union, and it is the only tag on the wire
//!
//! A `Fact`-typed field holds either a [`FactId`] the producer already has or the
//! target fact written inline
//! ([settled](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/PLAN.md#settled-decisions--recorded-so-they-are-not-reopened)).
//! That choice is genuinely per-occurrence, so it is the one thing the schema cannot
//! predict and the one place a discriminator is written — a varint branch index,
//! which is exactly how Avro encodes a union. It appears only at `Fact`-typed
//! positions, and the schema says where those are.
//!
//! The nested branch carries **no predicate id**: `PredicateTy::Fact(p)` names its
//! target predicate, so the reader knows what it is about to read. A nested fact
//! costs one byte plus its own key and value, and nothing else.
//!
//! # What is not encoded, and why each absence is safe
//!
//! | not sent | because |
//! |---|---|
//! | field names | the schema has them ([I13](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i13)) |
//! | field types | likewise — this is why there are no markers |
//! | record arity | the schema's field list has the count |
//! | a record terminator | a record ends when its fields do, which the schema says |
//! | a nested fact's predicate | `PredicateTy::Fact(p)` names it |
//! | a value-side presence flag | `Predicate::value` is `Some` or it is not |
//! | a null | [`PredicateTy`] has no null. PostgreSQL sends a `-1` length per column because SQL columns are nullable; this type model has nothing to spend that byte on |
