//! **The transport codec** — how a fact travels, as against how one is stored.
//!
//! There are two codecs in Fjord and they share no bytes, no code and no
//! constraints. Blurring them is the mistake this crate exists to make structurally
//! impossible, so it is worth saying once, at the top, what each is for:
//!
//! | | storage — `fjord-encoding` | transport — here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | read by | the executor, off disk, in the scan hot loop | a peer, off a socket |
//! | ordered? | **yes** — `memcmp` *is* semantic order ([I1]) | no. Nothing memcmps a frame |
//! | self-delimiting? | **yes** — skip a field with no schema ([I2]) | no. The reader has the schema |
//! | frozen? | **yes**, the moment data exists ([I3]) | no — versioned by the handshake, and a stream is a moment long |
//! | optimised for | seeking, skipping, ranges | **bytes on the wire, and nothing else** |
//!
//! Every marker byte in the storage codec buys one of the first three properties.
//! None of them is worth anything on a socket, so none of them is here. What replaces
//! them is the observation that **both peers already have the schema** — the handshake
//! compares fingerprints before any data flows, and [I13] freezes a DB's schema at
//! create — which means field names, field order, arities and types need not be sent
//! at all.
//!
//! (The design book's [wire protocol
//! page](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/wire-protocol.md)
//! holds the argument against per-field tags.)
//!
//! ```text
//!   src.Decl { module = <src.Module …>, name = "key_of", line = 12 }
//!
//!   storage    22 51 <8-byte id> 21 6B 65 79 5F 6F 66 00 49 0C 00
//!              └ record          └ string, escaped, terminated
//!                                              └ int: marker + magnitude
//!
//!   transport  01 <nested fact…> 06 6B 65 79 5F 6F 66 18
//!              └ union branch    └ len + raw bytes      └ zigzag varint
//! ```
//!
//! # The modules, bottom to top
//!
//! - [`varint`] — LEB128 over zigzag, the primitive everything else is built from,
//!   and where "not order-preserving" turns into bytes saved.
//! - [`value`] — the schema-driven value and fact encoding, and the **one** tag on
//!   the wire: a reference is a union of *an id* and *the target fact itself*
//!   ([settled]).
//! - [`crc`] — CRC-32, the standard one, for a block's integrity check.
//! - [`block`] — a run of facts of one predicate, behind a sync marker and a
//!   checksummed header. **The same bytes on a socket and on disk**: a `CopyData`
//!   frame's payload is a block, and a fact file is blocks back to back, which is
//!   what makes "one fact encoding, not two" checkable rather than aspirational.
//! - [`desc`] — a **row descriptor**: the outbound direction's type source, since a
//!   query row is shaped by the head rather than by a predicate. Sent once per
//!   stream; rows then use the same value codec a fact's key does.
//! - [`frame`] — `[kind][stream][length]`, the connection's multiplexing unit.
//! - [`protocol`] — the **message vocabulary**: which kinds exist, what a startup
//!   frame carries, what a stream's life looks like. Strictly above [`frame`], which
//!   delimits messages and deliberately does not interpret them.
//!
//! The layering is worth reading as a claim about *where a length comes from*.
//! [`value`] has no lengths at all — the schema says where every field ends.
//! [`block`] has one, because a splitter must skip a block it will not parse.
//! [`frame`] has one, because a socket reader must know how many bytes to await.
//! Each is the least that layer can do its job with.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here yet
//!
//! **The file envelope.** A fact file's header (magic, format version, producing
//! schema fingerprint) and its optional footer of block offsets are
//! [file ingestion](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/PLAN.md)'s and arrive with
//! the rest of the file pipeline. Blocks are here because they are shared with the
//! wire; the envelope is not shared with anything.
//!
//! **A session, and any I/O policy.** [`protocol`] says what a startup frame *means*;
//! it opens no socket, holds no state and decides nothing about retries, timeouts or
//! concurrency. That is `fjord-client`'s on one side and `fjord-server`'s on the
//! other, and it is why both can share this crate without sharing each other —
//! "shared by server and client, no I/O policy" — a client depending on the server
//! would drag in fjall, the engine and a runtime to send a handshake, and a second
//! copy of the message formats is exactly the drift the .NET client exists to detect
//! rather than to cause.
