//! **The message vocabulary** — what a frame's payload means.
//!
//! [`frame`](crate::frame) delimits messages and deliberately does not interpret

//! carries, and what a stream's life looks like. Kept apart from the codec so a
//! client can be written against the wire format without adopting a server's idea of
//! a session — which is exactly what the .NET client does.
//!

//!
//! # The lifecycle is a stream like any other
//!
//! `create`, `finish` and `remove` are [control](Control) frames on an ordinary
//! stream, which is what makes them work **against a running server** instead of
//! requiring one to be stopped ([operations §5](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/operations.md)).
//! Putting them on a stream rather than on stream 0 buys the whole of the existing
//! machinery: they queue fairly behind other work, a failure answers on the stream that
//! caused it, and a slow `create` does not stall the connection's reader.
//!
//! `list` and `describe` are **not** here, and their absence is `ops-I7` rather than a
//! gap: enumeration reads sidecars and never opens fjall, so it already works while a
//! server holds every database under the root; remotely they are answered through the
//! virtual predicate `fjord.db.List` — the normal query machinery, no bespoke message.
//!
//! All of it is **additive**, so [`VERSION`] does not move: a client that predates
//! control frames never sends one and is never sent one. The .NET client under
//! `clients/dotnet` is the check that this is true rather than hoped.
//!
//! # Asking what an id names is a question of its own
//!
//! [`FETCH`](kinds::FETCH) is the read-path twin of a nested reference on the way in: a
//! row carries a reference as a `FactId`, and this answers with the fact. It is additive
//! on the same terms — a client that never asks neither sends it nor receives a reply —
//! and it is deliberately **not** a fifth query kind. Expansion is orthogonal to paging,
//! profiling and counting, so a query kind for it would need one per combination;
//! asking about the ids in a row after the row arrived composes with all of them.
//!
//! # A virtual listing is a view, and a view can move between two requests
//!
//! `fjord.db.List`'s rows are materialised from the store root when a query is
//! prepared, not read out of a keyspace — so an id in one of its rows is a *position*
//! in that listing rather than a stored identity, and a database created or removed
//! between the query and a [`kinds::FETCH`] of one of its ids can renumber the
//! listing under it. That is not the same failure `Found::Unstored` already answers:
//! a moved position does not go missing, it names a *different* row, and a fetch that
//! resolved it would answer for the wrong database without either end noticing.
//!
//! No cursor is involved — a fetch is its own request, unrelated to any query's resume
//! token — so the fix travels with the rows themselves: a result that reads a virtual
//! predicate reports [`kinds::LISTING_DIGEST`] once per non-empty virtual predicate,
//! right after its row description, and a client asking to expand one of its ids sends
//! that predicate's number back on the
//! [`kinds::FETCH`] that names it. The server recomputes the current digest and
//! refuses the whole request by name when the two disagree, rather than resolving an
//! id against a listing it was never minted from. A fetch that names no digest — an id
//! typed by hand, or one read before this existed — is resolved as it always was.
//!
//! # Every message is a frame, including the handshake
//!
//! PostgreSQL's startup packet is special-cased — length-prefixed with no type byte —
//! because it predates its own message framing. There is no reason to inherit that:
//! a startup frame here is an ordinary frame with kind `S`, so a reader has one loop
//! rather than a preamble and then a loop.
//!
//! # Numbers are varints, not fixed width
//!
//! Payload fields use the same [`varint`] encoding the value codec
//! does. The fixed-width fields in the format are exactly the ones something must
//! *skip* without parsing — a frame's length, a block's — and a handshake field is
//! never skipped.
