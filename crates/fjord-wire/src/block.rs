//! **Blocks** — the unit a fact travels in, on a socket and on disk alike.
//!
//! One block is a run of facts of *one predicate*, so the predicate id is paid once
//! rather than per fact. An indexer writing in visitation order emits small blocks in
//! bursts; a writer that has grouped its output emits large ones
//! ([operations §8](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/operations.md)). The same bytes are a
//! `CopyData` frame's payload on the wire and a run of a fact file on disk, which is
//! what makes "one fact encoding, not two" a thing that can be checked.
//!
//! ```text
//!   [sync: FF × 10][magic "FJBK"][name_len u32][count u32][length u32][crc32 u32][name][payload]
//!    └ 10 B         └────────────────── header, 20 B ─────────────────┘  └ name_len  └ length B
//! ```
//!
//! # The predicate is named, not numbered
//!
//! A header carrying the *database's* predicate id would make a fact file meaningful only
//! against the database whose numbering produced it, and would make every client keep a
//! table of ids in step with a server's. A name costs about six more
//! bytes **once per block**, against payloads of hundreds to thousands of facts, and buys
//! both back: a client never learns a database's numbering, and a file is portable to any
//! database whose schema declares those names.
//!
//! It is also a better failure. A wrong id decoded the payload as some other predicate's
//! shape, silently; a name that is not there is [`WireError::UnknownPredicateName`], before
//! a byte of payload is trusted.
//!
//! The name sits **after** the fixed-width fields, so a reader reaches `length` at a
//! fixed offset and can skip a block it does not want without parsing it.
//!
//! # The marker, and what it is now for
//!
//! A block opens with ten `0xFF` bytes. It was put there for a splitter — seek into a
//! file at an arbitrary offset, scan forward to the next block, hand the rest to a
//! worker — and that splitter was never built. Facts arrive over the socket, and the
//! one file this format is written to is `--emit`'s golden, which is read from the
//! start.
//!
//! **So the marker is a check rather than an index.** `decode_header` refuses bytes
//! that do not begin with it, which catches a caller handing over the wrong offset,
//! and the header's own CRC catches the rest. What went with the splitter is the
//! machinery that scanned *for* it — and the question that machinery could never
//! answer: a damaged block and a false candidate are the same bytes to a scan, so
//! resuming past one means resuming past the other, and a corruption `decode_block`
//! would have reported becomes a file that quietly holds fewer facts.
//!
//! It stays in the format because it is on the wire: every `CopyData` payload carries
//! one, and two client implementations write it. Taking it out is a protocol change,
//! not a tidy-up.
//!
//! **A run of blocks is walked by its own lengths.** `decode_block` returns
//! `OVERHEAD + name_len + length` as its consumed count, so a reader steps from one
//! block to the next exactly, with no payload byte ever weighed as a boundary.
//!
//! # Fixed-width fields, and little-endian
//!
//! The header is fixed-width where the payload is varints, because a reader has to
//! read `length` *before* it can trust anything else — a variable-width field would
//! have to be parsed to be skipped, and skipping is what walking the chain is. Little-endian
//! because there is nothing to order: the storage codec's big-endian is an
//! [I1](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i1) requirement, and this is the file where that
//! requirement is not inherited.
