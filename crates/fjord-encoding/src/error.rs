//! What a decode can refuse.
//!
//! One type, in the crate that owns the bytes: every variant is either "these
//! bytes are not what the marker says" or "the schema and the bytes disagree".
//! Layers above wrap it — a store surfaces it as a corrupt row, the engine as a
//! decode error — but neither can add to it, which is the point of it living
//! here.
