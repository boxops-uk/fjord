//! **Fjord DB** — an embedded, immutable fact database — from a client's side of the
//! socket.
//!
//! This crate is a façade and holds no logic. It exists so that getting started is
//! `cargo add fjord-db` rather than three crates chosen correctly: the client
//! ([`fjord_client`]), the type model and schema language ([`fjord_schema`]), and the
//! transport codec and message vocabulary ([`fjord_wire`]). Those three are published
//! and documented in their own right; nothing here shadows them, and reaching for one
//! directly is not a worse thing to do.
//!
//! What is **not** here is the rest of the implementation. The storage codec, the store,
//! the query engine, the write funnel and the server are internal crates and are not
//! published, because a package is what it takes to talk to a database and read rows
//! back — not the shape of what is answering.
//!
//! # A database has a schema, and the client must have it too
//!
//! Nothing in the protocol describes the data model: the value codec sends no field
//! names, no type markers and no record arities, because both ends already have them.
//! So the first thing a program needs is a [`Schema`].
//!
//! A **reader** can ask the server for the one the database was created against, which is
//! the only way to be right about it — a schema is frozen into the database at create
//! ([I13]) and the server serves each database from its own embedded copy:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fjord_db::{Connection, Mode, Schema};
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), fjord_db::ClientError> {
//! use std::{path::Path, sync::Arc};
//!
//! // No claim to make, so none is made.
//! let mut connection = Connection::connect(
//!     Path::new("/tmp/fjord.sock"),
//!     "code",
//!     Arc::new(Schema::empty()),
//!     Mode::ReadOnly,
//!     false,
//! )?;
//!
//! let schema = Arc::new(connection.served_schema()?);
//!
//! let mut rows = connection.query("F where src.File F")?;
//! for row in connection.take(&mut rows, 20)? {
//!     println!("{row:?}");
//! }
//! # let _ = schema;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! A **producer** has to state the schema itself and assert it, because it is about to
//! encode facts against it — and a disagreement discovered at the handshake is a refused
//! connection rather than a database full of rows nobody can read back.
//!
//! A schema is one or more `.sigla` files: an `import` names another namespace, and what
//! a producer needs is the **union**. So the reader takes the set, the entry first, and
//! follows the imports through it — which is what lets a producer embed its schema with
//! `include_str!` and touch no filesystem at all:
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // In a real producer these are `include_str!`s.
//! let entry = "schema app { import base\n predicate Use : { of : base.Thing } }";
//! let base = "schema base { predicate Thing : string }";
//!
//! let schema = fjord_db::read_schema([("app.sigla", entry), ("base.sigla", base)])?;
//!
//! assert_eq!(schema.len(), 2);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The list's **order is the search order**: where two sources claim one import name,
//! the first wins. Reading from disk instead is
//! [`fjord_schema::syntax::resolve::resolve`], which searches directories in the same
//! way.
//!
//! # A reference is the whole target fact
//!
//! On the way in, a reference is the fact it names, nested inline to any depth — not an
//! id. A producer therefore keeps no book of what it has already written: it emits what
//! it holds where it stands, and the write path *interns* each nested fact into a
//! [`FactId`], creating it or finding what that key already names. Sending the same facts
//! twice writes nothing, which is what makes retrying after a dropped connection safe.
//!
//! Stored, a reference is an id and nothing else. Reading one back is the same shape by
//! asking: [`Connection::fetch`] answers *what fact does this id name* with the target's
//! key, and [`Expander`] walks that recursively — how deep to expand is a display
//! decision, so it is the client's, and the server does one point read per id.
//!
