//! Store-shaped test support: what a battery needs in order to *hold a store to
//! its contract*, as opposed to running a query against one.
//!
//! Here rather than in the engine's fixtures because of what these touch. The
//! probes and the model stores implement [`FactStore`](crate::fact_store::FactStore),
//! and the two scan assertions are the trait's contract written as tests — both
//! implementations must reject a short bound identically and neither may scan
//! past a predicate boundary. Kept a crate away, a probe would be a *different*
//! `FactStore` from the one under test.
//!
//! The value helpers travel with them because every one of these takes or
//! produces encoded bytes.
//!
//! Gated behind `proptest` so the engine's batteries can import them
//! ([testing](../../../website/content/testing.md)).
