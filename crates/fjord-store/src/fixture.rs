//! The **fixture database** the tests share: the schema queries are written against
//! and the facts they run against.
//!
//! Shared, and that is the point. The engine's `corpus` says what the
//! compiler must do with a snippet *and what it answers*, and the flatten batteries
//! assert plan shapes over the same rows — so a shape asserted in one place and an
//! answer asserted in the other are about one database rather than two that have
//! drifted.
//!
//! # The schema
//!
//! ```text
//! predicate test.Foo    : { id : int, name : string } -> string
//! predicate test.Bar    : { id : int }
//! predicate test.Edge   : { from : int, to : int }
//! predicate test.Node   : { id : int }
//! predicate test.Nested : { outer : { inner : int } }
//! predicate test.Name   : string
//! predicate test.Count  : int
//! predicate test.Shadow : { value : int }              // `.value` is ambiguous on it
//! predicate test.Wide   : { outer : { extra : int, inner : int } }
//! predicate test.Ref    : { of : test.Foo }            // a fact-typed field
//! predicate test.Link   : { at : int, of : test.Foo }  // ...not in the leading field
//! predicate test.Deep   : { via : test.Ref }           // ...and a chain of two hops
//! predicate test.Boxed  : { id : int } -> { lo : int, hi : int }   // a record *value*
//! predicate test.Named  : { name : string, of : test.Foo }  // a *string* before a ref
//! predicate test.Tagged : { what : union, id : int }    // a union in the *leading* field
//! predicate test.Label  : { id : int, what : union }    // ...and not in the leading field
//!
//! where `union` is `{ num : int = 3 | text : string = 0 }` in both — tags neither
//! contiguous, nor starting at zero, nor in declaration order, so nothing that read a
//! discriminant as a position could pass.
//! ```
//!
//! Four of those are deliberate awkward cases rather than data: `test.Shadow` has a
//! key field literally named `value`, `test.Wide` carries `test.Nested`'s field name
//! with a differently-shaped record, and `test.Ref`/`test.Link` differ only in
//! whether the reference is the *leading* key field — which is what decides whether
//! a fact-id compare narrows the scan or filters it. `test.Tagged`/`test.Label` are
//! the same pair for a union: leading, matching an alternative is a **seek**; behind
//! an `int`, it is a **residual**, and only one of those exercises
//! `check_residuals`.
//!
//! # The facts
//!
//! A **sequence is per predicate and 1-based** ([I11]), and a reference carries the
//! whole [`FactId`] — predicate tag included — so the facts have to know their own
//! numbering. [`facts`] therefore yields the sequence alongside each fact, in the
//! order it must be written, and every store built from it agrees fact for fact,
//! ids included: an in-memory one takes the sequence directly, and a real
//! [`FjallDb`](crate::store::FjallDb) is checked against what its allocator
//! hands out.
