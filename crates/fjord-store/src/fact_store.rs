//! The **storage seam**: what the engine is allowed to ask of a store.
//!
//! Its own module rather than a section of either implementation, or of the
//! engine's `plan`, where it used to live. A plan is a description; a store is a thing that answers. Keeping the
//! trait where either implementation could be mistaken for the definition is what
//! makes a seam quietly grow the shape of one side of it.
//!
//! Two implementations meet here: `FjallStore` (`fjord-store-fjall`) on disk
//! and `MemStore` (`fjord-store-mem`) in memory, held to
//! each other as a differential oracle
//! ([testing](../../../web/src/content/testing.mdx)). The executor consumes a `(handle,
//! snapshot)` and assumes nothing about a connection, which is the cut that lets
//! the same engine run embedded and served
//! ([operations §10](../../../web/src/content/operations.mdx)).
