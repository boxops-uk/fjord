//! What the storage layer can refuse — three types, one umbrella.
//!
//! [`StoreError`] is the umbrella the engine sees; [`FormatError`] and
//! [`FactError`] are arms of it, kept separate because they are raised at
//! different moments. A format stamp is checked once at open, before a row is
//! touched; a fact is checked on the way in, against the schema it is being
//! written under.
//!
//! Everything here is a *data* condition rather than an impossibility: the read
//! path decodes bytes it did not produce in this process, so corruption surfaces
//! as a typed error and never as a panic
//! ([conventions](../../../AGENTS.md)).
