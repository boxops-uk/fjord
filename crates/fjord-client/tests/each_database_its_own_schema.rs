//! **One store root, two schemas** — [I13](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/web/src/content/invariants.mdx#i13) made real.
//!
//! Until 8.4 a server was handed one schema and served every database with it, which
//! was true enough while the schema was compiled into the binary. Once `create` takes a
//! schema file, "the schema" stops existing: a root holds artifacts built at different
//! times from different declarations, and each one has to be read back from the copy it
//! embedded.
//!
//! What is checked here is the consequence a person would notice: the same query is
//! answered by one database and refused by the other, because the predicate it names is
//! only in one of them — and the handshake fingerprints differ, so a client asserting
//! the wrong schema is told before it writes anything.
