//! **[I13](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/web/src/content/invariants.mdx#i13)** — the DB's schema is embedded and frozen
//! at create, and every ingest is validated against it by **subset containment**.
//!
//! The guard lives here rather than in `fjord-schema` because it could never have run
//! there: validating an ingest needs a database to validate against, a schema that was
//! parsed rather than built, and a write path — so the guard
//! lives here, over the real client and the real server, and
//! [`web/src/content/invariants.mdx`](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/web/src/content/invariants.mdx) points at it by this name.
//!
//! # What containment means on the way in
//!
//! Chapter 6 settles compatibility as `old ⊆ new` over `name → predicate fingerprint`.
//! A producer is the same question asked from the other end: **everything it claims
//! must be in the database, identically**. So —
//!
//! - a producer declaring *fewer* predicates is accepted, which is the case that makes
//!   the rule worth having: an indexer that writes six of twenty-seven predicates
//!   should not have to restate the twenty-one it never touches;
//! - a *renamed* predicate is refused, because the database does not hold it;
//! - a *changed key type* and a *dropped field* are refused, because the database holds
//!   that name and not that shape — and a fact encoded against the producer's idea of it
//!   would decode as something else rather than fail.
//!
//! Each of those is a fact file's producing schema in [chapter 6](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/web/src/content/schema-language.mdx)'s
//! wording; over the write stream, the producer *is* the file's header, so the check
//! lands at the handshake and no bytes flow before it.
