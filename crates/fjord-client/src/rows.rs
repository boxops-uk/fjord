//! A query result, and the place a client keeps in it.
//!
//! # A bookmark, not an iterator
//!
//! [`Rows`] holds no borrow of the connection, and that is the design rather than an
//! inconvenience. A `Rows` that borrowed the socket mutably would make it impossible to
//! have two open — and two open is the point of the stream id, of the server's
//! per-stream tasks, and of a shell that can hold one result at `\more` while running
//! another query. So the connection does the I/O and this is what remembers where the
//! last one stopped.
//!
//! Nothing here buffers rows. The place is kept by the *stream* staying open, which
//! costs the server a suspended query loop and a bytes-only cursor — never a snapshot
//! ([I8](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i8)).
