//! **Expanding a reference into the fact it names**, recursively.
//!
//! A row carries a reference as a `FactId`, because that is what a reference *is* once
//! stored ([chapter 3](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/storage.md)). So a query over a code index
//! answers `{"to": "#3:7", "file": "#1:12"}`, and the two interesting fields of the
//! interesting predicate are numbers naming facts the reader cannot see. This turns them
//! into the facts:
//!
//! ```text
//!   {"to": "#3:7", "file": "#1:12"}
//!   {"to": {"module": {"file": "store/codec.py", "name": "store"}, "name": "encode",
//!           "line": 12},
//!    "file": "store/codec.py"}
//! ```
//!
//! # It is the logical form, which is a shape this project already has a name for
//!
//! Expanding every reference to its target's **key**, recursively, is the definition of
//! a database's canonical *logical* form: it is what `ops-I4`'s content hash is computed
//! over, and it is what a producer sends when it nests a reference rather than holding
//! an id ([settled]). So an expanded row and the form a producer would have written the
//! same fact in are one shape rather than two — and the expanded value is built out of
//! [`WireRef::Nested`], the vocabulary that already existed for the inbound direction,
//! rather than out of something new for display.
//!
//! The **value side is not expanded**, for the reason the wire's `Fetched` gives: a
//! reference names an identity, the identity is the key, and the value is a different
//! read that a query can already ask for by name (`X.value`).
//!
//! # Why it is a client's job
//!
//! Every readable shape in this tool is made client-side — the server carries the binary
//! format and nothing else — and expansion is a *display* decision: how deep, whether at
//! all, and what to do about an id that resolves to nothing are all questions about the
//! reader rather than about the data. What the client cannot do alone is the one thing it
//! asks for: [`Connection::fetch`] is the point read, because sigla names a fact by its
//! key and never by its number.
//!
//! # What it costs, stated plainly
//!
//! One point read per distinct id, and **one round trip per level of depth** rather than
//! one per reference: the walk is breadth-first, so a row's references are resolved
//! together, then their references together, and so on. The cache is what makes this
//! affordable on a real index — a page of references into one file names that file's id
//! forty times — and it is kept across pages for the same reason.
//!
//! A reference that resolves to nothing is left as the id it was. That cannot happen for
//! an id lifted out of a row — both column families are written together
//! ([I12](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i12)) and ids are never reused
//! ([I11](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i11)) — so it means corruption, and
//! [`unresolved`](Expander::unresolved) counts it rather than hiding it behind a
//! plausible-looking row.
//!
//! # `fjord.db.List` is a view, and a view can move
//!
//! Not every reference names a *stored* fact: `X where X = fjord.db.List _` heads a row
//! whose id is a position in a listing materialised for that query, so a database
//! created or removed since can renumber it — the id then names a *different* row,
//! which looks exactly like success rather than like the absence the cache would
//! otherwise expect. [`expand`](Expander::expand) is handed the digests the row's own
//! result carried and passes the matching predicate's digest to each fetch, so the server can
//! refuse that case by name; see [`Connection::fetch`](crate::Connection::fetch).
//!
