//! The **embedded schema copy** — `schema/` beside the sidecar.
//!
//! [I13](../../../web/src/content/invariants.mdx#i13): a database carries its own schema, embedded
//! at create and frozen for its lifetime. This is that copy, and it is
//! **load-bearing** rather than belt-and-braces: it is what a server reads to learn what
//! a database holds, so a store root can hold databases built from different schemas
//! without anything having to be told which.
//!
//! # It is source, in the language `create --schema` takes
//!
//! Not JSON, which is what it was until 8.4, and not
//! [the canonical form](fjord_schema::fingerprint) either. The canonical form's job
//! is to be *hashed* — embedding it would need a second parser for a second grammar,
//! whose only reader would be this crate. Source needs no new reader at all, and it is
//! the one form a person can read, diff, and hand back to `create`.
//!
//! # Written in id order, and read back with [`syntax::recover`]
//!
//! A predicate's id is a *position*, and it is the tag in every
//! [`FactId`](fjord_schema::id::FactId) the database holds. Ordinary lowering assigns
//! ids by sorted name ([D1](../../../web/src/content/schema-language.mdx)) — right for a schema
//! being declared, and wrong here, where the numbering is already frozen on disk. So the
//! copy is printed in id order and read back in declaration order, and `create` proves
//! the round trip before the database exists at all.
