//! The store layer — the fjall [`FactStore`].
//!
//! The layout is [chapter 3](../../../website/content/storage.md): a `keys` row is
//! `predicate_id (4B BE) ++ encoded_key → fact_id (8B BE)`, an `entities` row is
//! `fact_id (8B BE) → [key_len u32 BE][encoded_key][value]`, and the two halves of
//! a fact are written in one batch ([I12](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i12)).
//!
//! Three implementation decisions this module makes; chapter 3 records the
//! reasoning and the measurements behind the first two.
//!
//! - **Both column families are split per predicate** — `keys.<id>` and
//!   `entities.<id>`. Per-predicate trees are what
//!   [operations §9](../../../website/content/operations.md) asks for: independent
//!   bulk-ingest trees, prefix-disjointness aligned with physical isolation, an
//!   O(1) wholesale drop when a derived predicate is recomputed, and per-predicate
//!   size/cardinality for free. Splitting `entities` too is what the snowflake
//!   [`FactId`] buys:
//!   [`point`](fjord_store::fact_store::FactStore::point) is handed a bare id, and the
//!   id's tag names the tree, so identity lookup stays one lookup. Were `entities`
//!   shared, dropping a derived predicate's `keys` tree would strand its values as
//!   unreclaimable garbage.
//! - **A predicate's trees are created on first write**, and
//!   [`FjallDb::create_predicates`] exists so a caller that knows its schema can
//!   pay that cost up front instead — keyspace creation is ~30 ms apiece
//!   (directory create plus fsyncs), which is not a cost to incur at an arbitrary
//!   point inside an ingest.
//! - **The predicate-id prefix stays on the stored `keys` row** even though the
//!   per-predicate tree makes it redundant. It costs 4 highly-compressible bytes
//!   and buys byte-identical rows across this store and
//!   `MemStore` (`fjord-store-mem`) — which is what lets the
//!   resume battery ([I4](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i4)) transfer to fjall
//!   unchanged, since the engine's `Cursor` is bytes-only and
//!   re-seeks by exactly these bytes.
//!
//! `FjallDb` is the long-lived handle and owns the id allocator
//! ([I11](../../../website/content/invariants.md#i11)); [`FjallDb::reader`] hands the executor
//! the `(handle, snapshot)` pair it consumes.

/// - `finish` walks every reference to compute identity, so a dangling one raises
///   `DanglingFactId` and the database cannot be sealed. It is never shipped.
/// - The id it named is **never reissued**, because `FjallDb::allocate` claims ranges
