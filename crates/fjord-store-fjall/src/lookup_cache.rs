//! The **ingest-time lookup cache**: what `(predicate, key)` already names.
//!
//! [`FjallDb::intern`](crate::store::FjallDb::intern) resolves every fact it is
//! handed, and a nested code index hands it the same parents over and over — one
//! `src.File` is nested inside thousands of references, each of which is otherwise
//! two live LSM point reads. On the 25M-fact `dotnet/runtime` index the server interned
//! 94.9M facts to create 25.0M, so **73.6% of that work was re-reading something
//! already present** (`bench/FINDINGS.md` §12).
//!
//! Glean has the same cache for the same reason, and calls it the same thing
//! (`glean/rts/cache.h`, *"An LRU fact cache for speeding up point lookups (and only
//! those) during writes"*). Ours is allowed to be much simpler, because a database
//! here is **written once and sealed**: an entry can never go stale, so there is no
//! coherence story, no invalidation, and no partial-fact bookkeeping.
//!
//! **Two generations rather than an LRU list.** A linked list per entry is what
//! Glean's own post-mortem warns about — its id-and-key maps *"used quite a bit of
//! memory (almost exactly as much as the facts themselves)"* — so this keeps two
//! hash maps and rotates them: lookups check `young`, then `old` (promoting on the
//! way), and when `young` fills, `old` is dropped and `young` becomes the new `old`.
//! Bursts on the same parents — exactly what a syntax walk emits — stay resident,
//! and the cost is one hash rather than a hash plus list surgery.
//!
//! # What it is built to have, and what comes next
//!
//! **A hit allocates nothing.** The question `intern` asks is not "give me the row"
//! but "is this key present, and does the stored value agree with the one I hold" —
//! so [`LookupCache::lookup`] answers *that*, comparing under the lock and handing
//! back an id. Returning the row instead would clone its value on every hit, which
//! is a heap allocation per interned reference on the one path whose entire purpose
//! is to remove per-reference work. Five of `code_index`'s 27 predicates carry a
//! value side and `src.Decl` — a hot parent — is one of them.
//!
//! **The bound is bytes, not entries.** An entry count does not bound memory: these
//! keys are encoded fact keys, and a corpus of long paths costs several times one of
//! short ones for the same count. The budget is charged per entry as `key + value`
//! plus [`ENTRY_OVERHEAD`], so a stated ceiling is a real one. At most twice the
//! budget is resident, since `old` is a whole generation.
//!
//! **Sharding.** Interning is striped by `hash(predicate ++ key)` and each stripe has
//! its own cache. This type is what
//! goes behind one stripe: `young`/`old` are already per-instance, and a stripe's
//! lock is what supplies the `&mut` a promote needs. The budget is then **divided**
//! across stripes, never multiplied by them.
