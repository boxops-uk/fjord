//! **Content identity** — `hash(canonical schema, base facts)`, computed at `finish`.
//!
//! [`ops-I4`](../../../website/content/operations.md) has asserted since before it was
//! computable that *"a DB built twice from identical inputs is identical"*, and that
//! identity is **always** the content hash. This is that hash.
//!
//! # Why it is computable at all
//!
//! The clause reads "hash the canonical schema and the base facts", and it is
//! computable only because a stored reference is expanded to its target's **logical
//! form** first: a physical `FactId` is a number two reproducible builds can
//! legitimately disagree about, since it depends on the order writes happened to
//! arrive in, so hashing one would make identity depend on nothing semantic.
//!
//! With [a reference sent as the target fact](../../../PLAN.md#settled-decisions--recorded-so-they-are-not-reopened),
//! a database has a canonical **logical** form: expand every reference to the key of
//! the fact it names, recursively, and no physical id appears anywhere. That is what
//! is hashed.
//!
//! ```text
//!   stored     src.Decl { line = 12, module = #1:3, name = "key_of" }
//!   logical    src.Decl { line = 12,
//!                         module = src.Module { file = src.File "keys.py",
//!                                               name = "keys" },
//!                         name = "key_of" }
//! ```
//!
//! # Order-independent by construction, not by argument
//!
//! Each fact is hashed on its own and the results are **summed**. Nothing depends on
//! the order facts are visited in, which matters more than it first appears: the
//! obvious alternative — walk each predicate's `keys` tree in order and hash
//! sequentially — is *not* order-independent, because that tree is sorted by the
//! **physical** key, and a key holding a reference sorts by the target's id. Two
//! databases with identical logical content and different id assignment would walk
//! their facts in different logical orders and hash differently.
//!
//! Summing sidesteps that entirely. It makes the hash a **multiset** hash: it sees
//! which facts exist and how many, and nothing about sequence. That is exactly the
//! property `ops-I4` wants, and it is a property of the construction rather than of an
//! argument about tree ordering that a future change could invalidate.
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! FNV-1a and a wrapping sum: a check that two builds produced the same content, not a
//! security boundary. Anyone who can write facts can obviously choose what the hash
//! is. Accidental collision is what it defends against, and a 64-bit digest is
//! proportionate to that.
