//! # There is no manifest
//!
//! [`ops-I7`](../../../website/content/operations.md): enumeration is a walk of the root
//! and a read of each sidecar, and **never opens fjall**. That is what lets `list`
//! work while a server holds every database under the root — the sidecars are
//! ordinary files, and the server's exclusive hold is on the fjall directories.
//!
//! Any index or cache over this must be rebuildable from a scan and never
//! authoritative. There isn't one, and this note is why there shouldn't be.
//!
//! # A name is a container, and an instance is a database
//!
//! `<name>` holds one directory per **instance**, and `create` adds one rather than
//! conflicting: a database-per-CI-run needs somewhere to go. This is the
//! Glean `Repo` shape — a name plus a version of it — with a generated
//! [ULID](crate::ulid) where Glean takes a caller-supplied revision.
//!
//! Which instance an unqualified name means is [`Intent`]'s answer and depends on what
//! the caller is about to do, because the cost of being wrong differs: a read ranks the
//! candidates and commits, a write or a delete refuses and names them. `name@instance`
//! (or any unambiguous prefix of the instance) says exactly which, and `@` is why a name
//! may not contain one.
//!
//! # Creation is all-or-nothing
//!
//! A database is built under a scratch name at the root and the finished **instance
//! directory is renamed into the name**. A rename is atomic, so a process killed at any
//! point leaves either no instance directory or a finished Writable one — never a
//! half-built one for [`list`](Catalog::list) to find and report as real. An empty
//! `<name>` directory can survive a failure and is inert: the scan looks for instance
//! ids inside it and finds none.
//!
//! The scratch directory is removed on every failure path by
//! `Scratch`. A hard kill can leave one behind; it starts with
//! a dot, so the scan skips it, and it is inert rather than misleading.
