//! `FJORD_META` — what a database says about itself, **without being opened**.
//!
//! The sidecar is the fast enumeration path
//! ([`ops-I7`](../../../web/src/content/operations.mdx)): `list` walks the store root
//! and reads these, never touching fjall — which is what lets it work while a server
//! holds every database in the root. The copy of the schema under `schema/` is the
//! durable fallback if a sidecar is lost; the sidecar is what is *read*.
//!
//! # Written atomically, or not at all
//!
//! Every write is temp → fsync → rename, and the rename is the moment the new
//! contents exist. [`ops-I3`](../../../web/src/content/operations.mdx) needs that of the
//! status flip in particular: `finish` must never be observable as "metadata says
//! Complete while data is not durable", so the flip has to be a single atomic act and
//! the last one.
//!
//! # The field list is fixed, and two absences are deliberate
//!
//! - **No `externally_modified`.** `ops-I6` is explicit: a marker that downgraded
//!   identity would contradict `ops-I4`'s "identity is always the content hash".
//!   Manual writes are trusted, not tracked.
//! - **No provenance.** Operations §5 records it as a genuine gap and a later
//!   addition; it is descriptive-only under `ops-I4` either way.
//!
//! Both are *additions* the versioned format can take later rather than migrations,
//! which is what [`Meta::VERSION`] is for.
//!
//! # JSON, and epoch milliseconds
//!
//! JSON because a person will `cat` this file, and because the alternative — a packed
//! binary — buys nothing for a document read once per database per listing.
//!
//! `created_at_ms` is epoch milliseconds rather than a formatted timestamp, which is
//! the less friendly choice made deliberately: rendering a civil date needs either a
//! dependency or thirty lines of calendar arithmetic in the storage layer, and the
//! value is descriptive (`ops-I4`) so nothing but a human ever reads it. The CLI
//! formats it.
