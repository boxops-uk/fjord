//! [I8](../../../web/src/content/invariants.mdx#i8) — an immutable snapshot per query,
//! released at every stop.
//!
//! An **integration** test rather than a unit test, and for a structural reason:
//! it is the one store guard that has to *run a query*, so it needs the engine,
//! and the engine depends on this crate. Reaching back through a dev-dependency
//! would compile a second copy of `fjord-store` — the store under test and
//! the store the engine links would be different types. From outside the crate
//! there is one of each, which is also the arrangement a caller sees.

/// structural: done, suspend, cancel and error unwind all drop the frame stack
/// and the store handle. This asserts it for each of the four, against two

/// snapshot open).

/// Untestable on `MemStore`, whose scan copies rows out and pins nothing — the
/// real store is the only place this invariant is observable.
