/// [I10](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i10) — **union
/// discriminants are stable and append-only**, built at 8.6.
///
/// **What the invariant asked for, and what is actually implementable.** Its guard was
/// specified as *"a renumber is rejected at load"*, and that cannot be built as
/// written: under [I13] a database's schema is frozen at create, so at load there is
/// only ever **one** schema and nothing to compare it against. The rule decomposes
/// into four checks, which together mean what I10 means — and each has a home:
///
/// 1. **Within one schema** — no two alternatives share a tag, and every alternative
///    has one. The only half a single schema can be checked for, and the only one that
///    is literally "at load": `syntax::lower`, with `reject/duplicate-discriminant`
///    and `reject/missing-discriminant`, pinned by the schema corpus.
/// 2. **Identity** — a tag is part of the canonical form, so renumbering moves the
///    per-predicate and whole-schema fingerprint, while *permuting* the declaration
///    does not. Below.
/// 3. **`schema diff`** — a renumber is Breaking, and so is an appended alternative;
///    the two are distinct and neither is Compatible. In `fjord-cli`'s `schema diff`
///    tests, where the verdict lives.
/// 4. **Decode** — a stored tag no alternative declares is
///    [`UnknownDiscriminant`](fjord_encoding::error::StoreCodecError::UnknownDiscriminant),
///    never a mis-read of whichever alternative sat nearby. In the codec's battery.
///
/// **What I10 buys, given I13.** Not cross-schema compatibility — the fingerprint
/// handshake already refuses a client whose schema disagrees, so a renumbered tag can
/// never be read by the schema that wrote the old one. What it buys is that a schema's
/// *edit history* keeps every fact any earlier version of it wrote meaning the same
/// thing: appending an alternative is a rebuild, where renumbering one would be a
/// reindex, and anything that ever exports or migrates these bytes stands on that.
