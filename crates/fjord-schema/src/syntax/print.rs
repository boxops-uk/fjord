//! [`Schema`] → source — the form a database **embeds**.
//!
//! [I13](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/invariants.md#i13) asks a database to carry its own schema,
//! and this is the half that makes the copy worth carrying: text in the same language
//! `fjord create --schema` takes, so a reader needs no second format and the parser
//! that already exists is the one that reads it back.
//!
//! # Why not the canonical form
//!
//! [`fingerprint`](crate::fingerprint) already renders a schema as a byte string, and
//! embedding *that* would need a second parser for a second grammar — one whose only
//! reader would be this crate. The canonical form's job is to be hashed; this one's is
//! to be read, diffed by a person, and handed back to `create`. They are different jobs
//! and the fingerprint keeps them honest: an embedded copy that lowers to a different
//! schema has a different fingerprint from the one the sidecar recorded.
//!
//! # Order is the artifact, which is why reading it back is [`recover`](super::recover)
//!
//! Predicates are printed **in id order**, because an id is a position and every
//! [`FactId`](crate::id::FactId) a database holds carries one as its tag. Reading the
//! copy back with [`lower`](super::lower::lower) would re-assign ids by sorted name
//! ([D1](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/schema-language.md)) — right for a schema being *declared*,
//! and wrong for one being *recovered*, where the numbering is already frozen on disk.
//! For every schema written down as text the two agree, since lowering sorted them in
//! the first place; for a hand-built one they need not, and the difference is a database
//! whose keyspace names no longer match its predicates.
