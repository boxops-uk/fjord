//! CST → [`Schema`]: the type model, built from text.
//!
//! Two passes, and the split is forced rather than stylistic. A predicate may name one
//! declared later in the file — or in another block entirely — so **every declaration is
//! collected before any type is resolved**. The first pass also assigns ids, because a
//! `PredicateTy::Fact` holds the referent's id and cannot be built until every id exists.
//!
//! # Ids come from the sorted name, and that is D1
//!
//! [`phase-8-schemas.md`](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/website/content/schema-language.md) settles this: an id is a
//! property of the *database*, assigned by sorted qualified name and then persisted and
//! append-only, never a function of where a declaration sits in a file. This module does
//! the assigning half — sort, then enumerate — which is what makes two orderings of one
//! schema produce identical ids and therefore identical databases.
//!
//! # What is refused, and what is merely absent
//!
//! Everything the grammar accepts and the type model cannot hold is refused **by name**
//! here rather than in the parser ([`Code`]), which is the whole of permissive-early.
//! Imports are *collected and not yet acted on*: resolving them is 8.4, and a schema that
//! imports nothing is the only kind this step can fully answer.
