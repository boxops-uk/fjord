//! The schema DSL's front end: lex → parse → lower.
//!
//! [Operations §10](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/web/src/content/operations.mdx) puts "parse → AST → canonical
//! model; imports/resolution; fingerprints" in this crate, which is why the bottom of
//! the stack has a grammar in it. The dependency *direction* is unchanged: nothing
//! above needs to know a schema was ever text.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! The full surface parses, and every construct the type model cannot yet hold draws a
//! named code rather than a syntax error ([`diag::Code`]).
//!
//! **A derivation's body is not in the grammar, and that is a recorded decision rather
//! than an oversight.** Angle parses queries and schemas with one grammar, so a
//! derivation body is simply a `query` non-terminal. Fjord split the two: `sigla`
//! lives in `fjord-engine`, which is *above* this crate, so a schema parser here
//! cannot parse a query without inverting the dependency. The declaration *form* is
//! accepted — `stored` marks a predicate as derived — and how the body is carried
//! across that boundary is settled when stored derivation needs it. The options are already
//! visible: a delimited raw span this crate never interprets, or moving the derivation
//! into the query language's own file.
