//! Diagnostics for the schema DSL, and the codes they carry.
//!
//! The same arrangement `sigla` has: a **code** is an enum rather than a string, so a
//! test asserts on identity instead of wording, and every construct the grammar accepts
//! but the type model cannot yet hold has one of its own. A code is what makes
//! permissive-early legible — the reader is told *which* feature is missing, at the
//! bytes where they wrote it.
//!
//! Kinds, by prefix:
//!
//! - **`nyi/…`** — accepted by the grammar, deferred by design. Every one of these is a
//!   thing the schema corpus has an entry for.
//! - **`reject/…`** — meaningless rather than deferred; it will never be accepted in
//!   this shape.
