//! **The shell, and nothing else.**
//!
//! Every export takes a `&str` and returns a `String` of JSON, and there is no
//! logic here — a function that needs a branch belongs in [`fjord_inspect`],
//! where the host suite covers it. What cannot be covered there is exactly what
//! is left here: the `wasm_bindgen` boundary.
//!
//! The boundary is `serde_json` in [`fjord_inspect`] and `JSON.parse` on the
//! other side — the encoder is deliberately *not* here, so the JSON a browser
//! receives is byte for byte the JSON the host suite asserts on. A string
//! because payloads are query-sized and a string is debuggable: a failing view
//! can be pasted into a terminal. `serde-wasm-bindgen` is the upgrade if
//! profiling ever asks for it; pre-empting it buys nothing.
//!
//! What a browser cannot do, stated so it is not filed as a gap: **ingest**,
//! because interning needs a real backend and durable id claims, and **schema
//! `import`**, because resolution reads files — so a browser schema is
//! single-file until a virtual resolver exists. Everything else runs here,
//! lexing to executing: the queries answer against a `MemStore` holding the
//! demo database, through the same executor the server runs.
