title: Storage model
description: Two column families, one keyspace per predicate, an order-preserving codec, snowflake fact ids, the atomic two-map write, and how a nested reference becomes an id.
---

Fjord stores every fact twice, in two sorted key–value maps, and the split is the reason
queries are fast at what they are fast at.

## Two column families

```text
  keys      predicate_id ++ encoded_key  →  fact_id
  entities  fact_id                      →  encoded_key + value
```

| | `keys` | `entities` |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | *Which facts match?* | *What is this fact?* |
| Read by | The scan hot loop, exclusively | A point lookup — projection, a fetch through a reference |
| Access | Prefix and range scans over sorted bytes | One key, one row |
| Contains | No values, ever | The key again, plus the value side |

A query over a predicate is a **prefix scan** of `keys`, because the predicate id is the
prefix of every one of its keys. Narrowing on leading key fields extends that prefix. This
only works because the encoding is order-preserving.

### A stored key is flat

`encoded_key` is the key type's top-level fields **back to back, with no record wrapper of
its own** — even when the key type is a record. A record *inside* a field keeps its wrapper,
because there it is one value among others and has to be skippable as one. Three things rest
on that asymmetry:

- **A seek extends a prefix by whole fields.** With a wrapper, every seek would carry a
  constant leading byte and none could stop before the terminator.
- **Field *k* costs *k* skips**, which is what the executor's field-offset cache holds.
- **A key is therefore not *a* field.** A plan addresses key fields by path, and no path
  names a whole record key — binding a variable to one is `nyi/whole-key`.

The executor never learns which convention wrote a row, so both encodings "work" until a plan
reads a field — and then one of them reads the wrong bytes **silently**. Pinned by
`codec::a_stored_key_is_its_fields_with_no_wrapper_of_its_own`.

### Why two, and not one

Because a value must never enter the scan loop ([I6](invariants.html#i6)). A single map
holding key *and* value would put value bytes in the way of every scan: more bytes read per
row, worse cache behaviour, and a hot loop whose cost depends on data a query did not ask
for. Splitting them makes "seek and filter on keys" and "read a value" two different
operations with two different costs — and makes the second one visible in a profile.

The price is that a fact is written in two places, which is why the write is atomic
([I12](invariants.html#i12)).

## One keyspace per predicate — for both maps

Each predicate gets its own **pair of physical trees**, `keys.<id>` and `entities.<id>`, and
the predicate id is still the key prefix in `keys`. Three consequences, all load-bearing:

- **Physical isolation.** Facts of different predicates cannot affect each other's storage,
  which is what makes ingest parallel across predicates. The storage engine's bulk path
  requires strictly ascending keys; a single shared tree would force one globally ordered
  serial sink.
- **Prefix-disjointness aligns with isolation.** "Predicate id is the key prefix" and "one
  tree per predicate" say the same thing at two levels, so a deriver reading predicate A and
  writing predicate B is structurally read/write-disjoint.
- **A predicate can be dropped wholesale in O(1)** by deleting its two trees — which is what
  re-deriving a derived predicate needs. In a shared tree that would mean range tombstones in
  a store whose premise is that nothing is ever deleted.

Splitting `entities` is possible **only** because a fact id carries its predicate: `point()`
is handed a bare id and no predicate, so an untagged id would turn identity lookup into a
search across every tree.

:::note What it costs
Creating a keyspace costs about **30 ms** (directory create plus fsyncs), so `create`
materialises every predicate's trees up front from the schema rather than lazily — a
twenty-seven-predicate schema is a measurable but one-off cost at create, not a surprise on
first write. The split also means memtable budgets are per tree rather than global, which is
an obligation the design records rather than a free win.
:::

## The tuple codec

The storage codec has three properties, and each is an invariant.

### 1. Order-preserving ([I1](invariants.html#i1))

```text
memcmp(encode(a), encode(b)) == compare(a, b)
```

That is what buys a **range** scan (not a filter) and rows in semantic order with no sort. It
is why `"ann" < "anna"` falls out of the bytes, and why a negative integer sorts below a
positive one.

Integers are the hard case — two's complement puts negatives above positives, and fixed width
wastes space. The scheme: variable width with the width carried **in the marker byte**, so the
marker sorts first and orders values across widths; negatives as the ones'-complement of the
magnitude, with *wider* negatives taking *smaller* markers so "more negative" sorts lower; and
one positive band shared by every integer type. The **decoder is a canonicalising validator** —
it recomputes the width and rejects any non-minimal encoding — because order preservation is
stated over encodings, and it holds only if one value has exactly one legal byte string.

A string prefix becomes a **range** by encoding the prefix and dropping its terminator, which
is what makes `"al"..` a byte range rather than a filter. The same trick is what lets a
[fuzzy match](fuzzy-search.html) compute where to seek next: the smallest key that could still
match is a prefix, encoded the same way.

Reading a stored string back has two forms, and the difference is a bound rather than a
convenience. The whole-value decoder finds the terminator before it yields anything, so the
*first* character of a 4 KiB identifier costs 4 KiB — which is exactly the cost a guided seek
exists to avoid, since a fuzzy match can reject on the fourth character. So there is also a
**character-at-a-time** reader that inspects only the bytes it yields and emits an escaped NUL
as a character rather than unescaping into a buffer. Two properties pin the two decoders
against each other so they cannot drift.

Every stored key of a whole database, in the order a scan meets them, as bytes and decoded.
The claim above is checkable here: read down the hex column and it ascends, and read down the
decoded column beside it and the values ascend in the same order.

:::demo store
P where code.File P; P = "src/"..
:::

Step it and the range being walked is shaded across the rows. `"src/"..` is a prefix, so the
band starts inside the predicate rather than at its first row — the range is bytes, and the
bytes are these.

### 2. Self-delimiting ([I2](invariants.html#i2))

The **marker byte** alone says how to advance past a value. `skip` needs no schema: a scan
can walk to the *n*th field of a key it has never seen the type of. Record nesting is
bounded, so malformed bytes are an error rather than a stack overflow.

One sharp edge is worth knowing before touching the codec. A record's terminator is `0x00`,
and a bare **null** is also `0x00` — so a null *element* inside a group is escaped as
`0x00 0xFF`, and in nested mode `skip` reads a `0x00` not followed by `0xFF` as the
terminator. An embedded NUL inside a string escapes the same way, and the ordering argument
for `"a" < "a\0"` then compares one row's terminator against the other's escape byte — which
holds **only because every marker a value can begin with is below `0xFF`**. That is a
requirement on the marker table, not a property of strings, and it is why the table's
reserved bands stop at `0xFE`.

### 3. Frozen on disk ([I3](invariants.html#i3))

Marker values and their relative order are semantic — a marker is the most significant part
of a value's sort key. Once data exists they cannot change. New types go into a **reserved
band** in the correct skip family, chosen so the type sorts where it should. A golden-bytes
test pins every marker so a renumber breaks loudly.

### The marker table

| Byte(s) | Marker | Meaning | Skip family |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | `MARK_NULL` / `MARK_TERM` | null · record terminator | (see below) |
| `0x01–0x20` | *reserved* | future types sorting below `String` | |
| `0x21` | `MARK_STRING` | UTF-8 string | terminator walk |
| `0x22` | `MARK_RECORD` | record start, paired with `MARK_TERM` | nested |
| `0x23–0x3F` | *reserved* | | |
| `0x40–0x47` | `MARK_INT_NEG` | negative integers, width 8 … 1 | width in marker |
| `0x48` | `MARK_INT_ZERO` | zero | fixed, 0 bytes |
| `0x49–0x50` | `MARK_INT_POS` | positive integers, width 1 … 8 | width in marker |
| `0x51` | `MARK_FACT_REF` | a reference to a fact | fixed, 8 bytes |
| `0x52` | `MARK_UNION` | a tagged alternative — discriminant, one payload, terminator | nested |
| `0x53–0xFE` | *reserved* | | |
| `0xFF` | `MARK_ESCAPE` | escapes a null element | — |

Reading the integer band: zero is the centre at `0x48`; positives climb as width grows, so
larger positives sort higher; negatives fall as width grows, so more-negative sorts lower.
The type ordering `null < string < record < integers < fact-ref < union` falls out of the
table.

A union was **appended** at `0x52` — which is what I3 permits, and the only thing it permits:
the table below it does not move. Highest in the table, so a union sorts after every other
type, and within a union by discriminant then payload — a key's alternatives **cluster**, and
matching one is a prefix of the key order rather than a filter over all of it. It is encoded
as a *group*, like a record: it carries a terminator and escapes a null payload even though
its arity of one would make the terminator redundant, so "is a group" stays a single concept
— terminated, null-escaping, depth-counted — and `skip` needs no notion of a value still
owed. A stored tag that no alternative declares is refused at decode
(`UnknownDiscriminant`), never read as whichever alternative sat nearby.

A fact reference has its **own** fixed-width marker rather than sharing the integer encoding,
so a value's bytes are self-describing without the schema and the `Int`/`Fact` distinction is
enforced at the byte level.

:::warn Every value marker stays below `MARK_ESCAPE`
That is why the reserved band stops at `0xFE`. A new type numbered `0xFF` would silently
invert string ordering across a record boundary — so the ceiling is part of what I3 freezes,
not a spare byte.
:::

For a future **container** type, the reserved band is not the whole decision: length-prefixed
or terminator-delimited is a choice *inside* the encoding, and a length-prefixed array cannot
be prefix-matched at all, because the length sorts ahead of the elements. That choice freezes
with the first stored value, exactly as a marker does — which is part of why arrays are an
open question rather than a reserved byte away.

## Fact ids are snowflakes ([I11](invariants.html#i11))

```text
   63          40 39                                    0
  ┌──────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ predicate id │ sequence within that predicate        │
  │   (24 bits)  │              (40 bits)                │
  └──────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘
    ≤ 16.7 M predicates      ≤ 1.1 T facts per predicate
```

The split is byte-aligned on purpose: the tag is the top three bytes of the big-endian
encoding, so routing a lookup to a predicate's tree is a slice rather than arithmetic.

Three things follow, and they are the reason for the design:

- **`entities` can be split per predicate** while `point()` stays one lookup from a bare id.
- **There is no global allocator.** Each predicate counts its own facts, so two workers on
  different predicates share no counter and write disjoint ascending ranges.
- **Uniqueness across predicates is structural**, not enforced: the tag partitions the space,
  so two predicates cannot collide however their sequences are allocated.

Sequences are per predicate and 1-based, which is what makes `#4:1` readable as "predicate 4,
first fact". Ids are **never reused within a database**, and they are not cross-database
identity: two databases built from the same inputs agree on *content*, not on numbering.

Ids are also claimed **durably ahead of use**, in chunks, because handing one out before its
fact is committed would let a crash reissue it to a different fact — turning a surviving
reference into one that resolves to the wrong target, silently.

## Interning a nested fact

A producer does not send ids. It sends **the target fact**, written inline where the
reference belongs, to any depth:

```text
    src.Decl {
      module = src.Module {                    ← a whole fact, not an id
        file = src.File "store/keys.py",       ← nested again
        name = "keys"
      },
      name = "key_of", line = 12
    }
```

**Interning is resolve-or-create, bottom-up.** At each nested fact: encode its key with the
storage codec, look that key up in the target predicate's `keys` tree, take the id if it is
there, allocate and write if it is not — then substitute the id into the parent and carry on.

The walk is bottom-up because it has to be: a parent's key has no bytes until its children
have ids. Three properties make it safe, and none of them is a new rule:

- **It terminates, and it is well founded.** A nested fact is a finite tree, and a reference
  *in a key* cannot be part of a cycle — the target must be fully identified before the
  referring key has any bytes at all. (Cycles are reachable only through *values*, where a
  reference is not implemented.)
- **"Already there" is dedup**, silently: a target nested under a thousand parents resolves to
  one row.
- **"There with a different value" is a conflict**, rejected deterministically — never
  last-writer-wins and never first-writer-wins, because either is order-dependent and
  reproducibility forbids it.

A consequence worth knowing before you hit it: **a single message can contradict itself.** A
nested fact both names and *defines* its target, so one message naming a target twice with two
different value sides is a producer disagreeing with itself, and is refused as an ordinary
conflict. Both orders reject, so the answer does not depend on the order the walk took.

This is why a producer needs no book: an indexer walking a syntax tree knows the file when it
reaches the declaration, and every id-based alternative would ask it to carry a map from every
entity to an assigned identity, plus an emission order that respects one.

## The atomic two-map write ([I12](invariants.html#i12))

`keys` and `entities` are written in a **single write batch**. A fact is never half-present:
never a key without its entity, never an entity without its key. The two failure directions
fail differently, which is why the guard checks both:

- a `keys` row with no `entities` row makes a value projection return nothing, surfacing as a
  dangling-id error;
- an `entities` row with no `keys` row is **invisible to every query** — silent, and
  undetectable without checking both directions.

### The other half: one key names exactly one fact

Atomicity is the easy half, and a batch delivers it whoever writes. The half a batch is
innocent of is **write-once**: writing the same key twice overwrites the `keys` row and
strands the first fact's entity — exactly the invisible orphan above.

That is the whole of what a parallel writer conflicts with. Two workers interning the same
nested target both find the key absent, both allocate, both write; one `keys` row survives and
the other entity is stranded.

**The mechanism is per-key exclusion**, striped by `hash(predicate_id ++ key_fields)` across
64 stripes, each holding its own slice of the "what does this key already name" cache behind
the same mutex — because the two want exactly the same critical section: *what this key
already names*, and *the right to decide it names nothing yet*.

It needs no lock-ordering discipline, and the reason is the bottom-up rule above: a worker's
critical sections run strictly leaf-then-parent and are never nested — it holds a child's
stripe, releases it, then takes the parent's. The property that makes interning total is the
property that makes it parallelisable.

:::warn Per-key exclusion is the weakest thing that works
A lock-free compare-and-swap on the `keys` tree would **not** be enough, and neither would
anything that lets a resolve proceed without excluding the writer of the same key. A write
batch is atomic on recovery but **not isolated** from a concurrent reader: a reader can see the
`keys` insert before the `entities` insert of the same batch. With one writer that question
never arose. So the stripe is held across the read *and* the commit.
:::

The guard is `store::concurrent_interning_of_one_key_creates_one_fact` — N threads racing on
one key, one id handed to all of them, the bijection intact. Single-threaded, the striping
costs one hash of the key: measured at 1–4%.

## The order a scan is promised in

A scan yields rows in **lexicographic key order**, and that is a commitment rather than an
implementation detail: resume re-seeks against it. It is also what makes rows come back in a
useful order for free — a file's references arrive in the order a renderer wants to splice
them, because position leads the rest of that predicate's key.

The commitment is stronger than the design this was taken from now offers — Glean returns
facts "in no specified order", which is what lets it *truncate* an over-long `keys` row and
re-check from `entities`. Committing to the order forecloses that: a backend that cannot hold
a whole key cannot hold this `keys` family, and there is no stated key-size budget or
degradation path above one. Both are recorded as open edges rather than answered.

`scan` itself is a **contract on the trait**, asserted directly against every implementation
rather than inferred from two stores agreeing — two stores that leak identically would satisfy
a differential and both still be wrong. A scan never leaves the predicate its lower bound
names (`assert_scan_stays_in_predicate` — fjall gets this structurally from one tree per
predicate; the in-memory model store once didn't), and a bound too short to name a predicate
is an **error in the call**, not a row (`assert_short_bound_is_rejected`).

## Snapshots

A query reads a **snapshot**. For an immutable database that is nearly free, but a storage
iterator pins one, and a paused query holding a pinned snapshot is a paused query holding
storage open. So the snapshot is **released at every suspend** ([I8](invariants.html#i8)) and
re-taken on resume — which is sound precisely because the data cannot have changed.

The guard for that one cross-checks a drop probe against the storage engine's own count of
open snapshots, because "we dropped our handle" and "the engine considers it closed" are two
different claims.

## The seam, and what is behind it

Everything above is what a store *does*. What the engine sees is much smaller — two
methods:

```rust
pub trait FactStore {
    type Scan: Iterator<Item = Result<(ByteView, FactId), StoreError>>;

    fn scan(&self, lo: &[u8], hi: Option<&[u8]>) -> Result<Self::Scan, StoreError>;
    fn point(&self, id: FactId) -> Result<Option<Entity>, StoreError>;
}
```

A range of `keys`, and one row of `entities`. That is the whole of the storage interface,
and it is why the executor can be described without saying the word *fjall*.

The seam is a crate of its own, holding the trait, the tuple a fact is written as, the
format stamp and the errors — **and linking no implementation of any of it**. Two crates
implement it: a fjall-backed database on disk, and an in-memory model. The model is not test
machinery. It is the oracle every executor battery is written against, and it is the store
that runs when the engine is compiled to WebAssembly, because it is the one that touches no
filesystem.

One consequence is worth stating, because it is the thing that keeps the seam a seam: the
error type carries a backend failure **without naming a backend**. `StoreError::Backend`
holds a boxed source, so *the backend failed* is the trait's business and *which* backend is
not. The cost is stated rather than hidden — recovering the concrete error takes a
downcast — and it is what makes a third implementation additive rather than an edit to a
shared enum. The lifecycle's own refusals (no such database, a held root lock, a database
that is Complete) are not on the seam at all: they are facts about how one backend keeps
databases in a filesystem, and they live with it.

## The format stamp ([I15](invariants.html#i15))

Every database says which format wrote it: a twelve-byte stamp in a metadata keyspace, with
`codec` and `storage` versioned **separately**, checked at open. An unreadable one is refused
rather than adopted, and a database holding facts with no stamp at all is refused rather than
assumed to be version 1.

Read the gain narrowly. It makes nothing migratable — I3 still binds every database stamped
`codec 1` exactly as before. What it buys is that a *future* codec is a different number
rather than an impossibility.

## On disk

```text
<data_dir>/
├── fjord.sock                     # the server's socket; its presence is server detection
└── <name>/<instance>/             # instance: a ULID
    ├── FJORD_META                 # the sidecar, written temp + fsync + rename
    │     name, instance, status (Writable|Complete|Broken), format version,
    │     schema fingerprint, content fingerprint (at finish), counts, size, created_at
    ├── schema/                    # the embedded canonical schema — the durable copy
    └── <storage files>            # keys.<id> / entities.<id> per predicate
```

The sidecar is the fast enumeration path — `list` and `describe` read it and **never open the
storage engine**, which is what lets them work while a server holds every database under the
root. The embedded schema copy inside the database is the durable fallback, and since the
schema DSL landed it is also the *source* a server reads a database's schema back from.

## Writing a fact by hand

Inside the process there is a second way in, used by the tests and the benchmarks:
`FjallDb::put(&schema, &fact)` takes a **well-typed value** whose key fields are named and
resolved against the schema.

It exists because the low-level `put_fact` takes bytes, and three of its preconditions fail
**silently**: a stored key is flat, field order is the schema's declaration order, and only the
schema says whether a predicate has a value side at all. Each mistake writes a fact that is
simply never found. `put` returns the id, so the fact you write next names this one by a value
you already hold — referential integrity as a consequence of write order rather than a check.

This is deliberately *not* bulk ingestion and deliberately not a `serde` derive. The wire
path is built **beside** it, not on top of it.

## Storage codec versus transport codec

They are siblings. Neither is a layer on the other, and they share no bytes.

| | Storage | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| int | Marker carrying the width, then big-endian minimal magnitude; negatives ones'-complemented | LEB128 varint over zigzag |
| string | Marker, **escaped** contents, terminator — a NUL costs two bytes | Varint length, then the bytes, unescaped |
| record | Marker, fields, terminator | The fields, concatenated. Nothing else |
| reference | Marker plus a fixed 8 bytes, so it sorts as a band of its own | A varint union branch: an id, **or the target fact** |
| field names, types, arities | Never present — self-delimiting by construction | **Not sent at all** — both peers hold the schema |

Measured on the shapes a code index holds, the transport encoding is **40% smaller** than the
storage one — and that comparison is a test rather than a claim. It is not a pointwise law:
a varint is longer at the extremes, and a length prefix passes three bytes at 16 KiB where a
terminator stays at one. The win is over the data, not over every value.
