title: Wire protocol
description: Frames, streams, the handshake, the four query kinds, the write stream, block format and the value encoding — everything a second implementation needs.
---

One socket, framed and multiplexed. Everything talks it: the CLI, the shell, the viewer, and a
C# client that shares no code with the server. Protocol version is **3**.

The transport is a Unix socket by default. TCP is an explicit opt-in — `serve --listen-tcp
host:port`, with no config-file entry and no environment variable, so a port can only appear
because somebody typed one.

## The frame layer

```text
  ┌────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
  │ kind:1 │ stream:4   │ length:4   │ payload (length bytes)     │
  └────────┴────────────┴────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
    9-byte header; the two counts are little-endian
```

PostgreSQL-inspired and deliberately **not** PostgreSQL-compatible. PG's header is a type byte
and a length, and every message belongs to the one conversation the connection *is* — strictly
serial, so a long query blocks a short one. The `stream` field is the departure and the reason
for departing: a query is a stream, a write is a stream, several run at once, and every frame
says which.

Two rules the frame layer holds and nothing above it needs to restate:

- **`kind` is a byte with named constants, not a closed enum.** A framing layer delimits
  messages; deciding what a message *means* is the layer above. An unrecognised kind is handed
  up intact, which is also what lets a peer at a newer version be told "I do not know that
  message" rather than "your bytes are malformed".
- **`length` is bounded before it is trusted**, because it sizes a read from a number the peer
  chose. The cap is 64 MiB (`MAX_PAYLOAD`).

## Frame kinds

| Byte | Name | Direction | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `S` | `STARTUP` | → | Version, database, session mode, schema claim |
| `R` | `READY` | ← | Version, the database's schema fingerprint, predicate count |
| `Q` | `QUERY` | → | Query text, on a new stream |
| `P` | `QUERY_PROFILE` | → | The same, and report what it examined |
| `G` | `QUERY_PAGE` | → | The same, stop after N rows and hand back a token |
| `N` | `QUERY_COUNT` | → | The same, report only how many rows |
| `T` | `ROW_DESCRIPTION` | ← | The head's shape, once per query stream |
| `l` | `LISTING_DIGEST` | ← | Which virtual predicate these ids were minted from, and the digest of that listing |
| `D` | `DATA_ROW` | ← | One row |
| `p` | `PROFILE` | ← | What the query examined, once, just before `C` |
| `n` | `COUNT` | ← | How many rows |
| `r` | `RESUME` | ← | The resume token, when a page was cut short |
| `C` | `COMPLETE` | ← | The stream finished, with counts |
| `E` | `ERROR` | ↔ | This stream failed, with a code and a message |
| `X` | `CANCEL` | → | Stop this stream |
| `W` | `OPEN_WRITE` | → | Open a write stream |
| `G` | `COPY_IN_RESPONSE` | ← | Ready for blocks *(write streams)* |
| `d` | `COPY_DATA` | ↔ | One block of facts |
| `c` | `COPY_DONE` | → | The write stream's blocks are finished |
| `L` | `CONTROL` | → | A lifecycle request: create, finish, remove |
| `M` | `CONTROL_REPLY` | ← | What it came to |
| `H` | `SCHEMA` | → | "What can I ask you?" — no payload |
| `h` | `SCHEMA_REPLY` | ← | The schema this session is served with, as source |
| `F` | `FETCH` | → | A batch of fact ids |
| `f` | `FETCHED` | ← | One key each, positionally, or an absence |

`G` appears twice, and that is not a typo: it is `QUERY_PAGE` from the client and
`COPY_IN_RESPONSE` from the server. A kind is only ever read in one direction, so the byte is
free to mean one thing outbound and another inbound — the same economy PostgreSQL's protocol
makes.

## The handshake

```text
  →  S   { version, database, mode, schema_fingerprint, [(predicate, fingerprint)…] }
  ←  R   { version, schema_fingerprint, predicates }
```

The database may be **empty**, which is a control session — the only kind of session a
`create` could be sent on.

`mode` is `read-only` or `read-write`, and it is resolved **once** against the database's
status: a Complete database is read-only, full stop, and a write session against one is refused
at establishment rather than per fact.

The schema claim has two halves, and both are checks the client chooses:

- **`schema_fingerprint`** is an equality claim, or `0` for "do not check". Zero is a real
  answer rather than a hole: a reader has nothing to assert.
- **`predicates`** is a per-predicate claim, checked by **subset containment** — which is what
  the freeze invariant actually says, and what lets a producer writing six of a database's
  twenty-seven predicates connect without restating the other twenty-one.

:::note There is no credential field
Access control is entirely the transport's job — socket permissions, or a gateway in front of
opted-in TCP. That is only safe because binding is default-closed, and it is stated as an
invariant (`ops-I10`) rather than left as an omission.
:::

## Asking what you may ask

```text
  →  H   (no payload)
  ←  h   the schema, as source
```

A database carries the schema it was created against, so a client's built-in copy is its own
opinion. `h` is the answer, and it is what lets a client describe the right predicates, compile
a query before sending it, and show a plan. **Virtual predicates are included**, because the
question is what may be asked rather than what the database holds.

## A query stream

```text
  →  Q   "{f = F, l = L} where src.Ref {…}"
  ←  T   {f: src.File, l: int}
  ←  D   one row
  ←  D   one row
  …
  ←  C   complete
```

Four query kinds rather than one kind with flags, and the reason is the same each time: `Q`'s
payload is the query text and nothing else, so a leading flag byte would be a silent change of
meaning for every client already sending UTF-8. A client that has never heard of profiling
neither sends `P` nor receives a `p`, and the protocol version does not move.

| Kind | Adds | Answers with |
|---|---|---|
| `Q` | — | `T`, `D`*, `C` |
| `P` | Report what it examined | …plus `p`, once, just before `C` |
| `G` | Stop after N rows | …plus `r`, **only** if the result was cut short and there is more |
| `N` | Count instead of encoding | `n` — no `T`, no `D` |

`G` is what makes paging **stateless**. Without it a result lives in the server's session, keyed
by stream id, and a caller has to hold the connection to see page two — which a web tier cannot
do and cannot work around, because "everything after key K" is not expressible in the language.
A page that reached the end sends **no** token, which is how a caller knows it has seen
everything without asking again to be told nothing.

`N` is the cheapest kind to justify: the plan is the same and the executor is the same, and what
differs is the accumulator — the driver is a fold, so counting is a fold that keeps a number.
It is **not** aggregation in the language.

### Rows

Rows go out **256 at a time**, off the executor's suspend, and the next chunk resumes from the
bytes-only cursor. So a result of any size never buffers in the server and never monopolises the
socket — and between chunks is exactly where a cancel gets its chance to land.

### Rows off a virtual predicate

A query reading a [virtual predicate](concepts.html) gets one extra frame per such predicate,
right after `T`:

```text
  ←  T   {name: string, state: string}
  ←  l   fjord.db.List, digest 9f3c…
  ←  D   one row
```

`fjord.db.List`'s rows are a **materialised view, not a keyspace**, so its ids are positions in
a listing rather than durable identities: a `create` or a `db rm` between two requests can
renumber it, and an id then lands on a *different* row rather than on none — which a reply
cannot be inspected to notice, because it looks exactly like a correct one. The digest travels
with the rows and comes back on a `FETCH`, which is what lets the server refuse that case by
name instead of answering it. It is also folded into a page's resume token, so the same move
between two pages is refused there too.

### Cancellation

```text
  →  X   (on the stream it cancels)
```

**In band, on the stream it cancels** — not a connection teardown and not a side channel. That
is the whole reason frames carry a stream id: cancelling a long query has to be possible without
disturbing the other streams sharing the socket, and a second connection could not do it because
the first one's state is not there.

### Errors

```text
  ←  E   { code, message }
```

A stream's failure leaves the connection usable. The code exists so a client can branch without
parsing English; the message exists because a person reads it.

| Code | Means |
|---|---|
| 1 `Protocol` | Malformed or out-of-sequence frames |
| 2 `UnknownDatabase` | No such database under this root |
| 3 `SchemaMismatch` | The claim disagrees with what this database holds |
| 4 `ModeRefused` | A write session against a Complete database |
| 5 `BadFacts` | A block that does not validate against the embedded schema |
| 6 `Conflict` | Same key, different value |
| 7 `BadQuery` | The query did not compile |
| 8 `Internal` | Look at the server's logs |
| 9 `InUse` | Something else holds this database — the one code worth **retrying** |
| 10 `Refused` | A well-formed request the server will not carry out — the answer is in the message |
| 11 `Busy` | The server is at its connection cap and never read the request — **come back**, the other code worth retrying |

`Busy` arrives where no other error can: **before the handshake**, in answer to the connection
itself rather than to anything on it. A client that has sent `STARTUP` and reads an error instead
of `READY` has been turned away at the door, and the connection closes behind it.

Two refusals are worth naming because a client can act on them. **A stale listing**: a `FETCH`
carrying a digest the current listing no longer matches is refused whole, before any id is
resolved — re-run the query and fetch against the new rows. **A volatile resume**: paging across
requests over `fjord.db.Interning` is refused, because its counters are read by locking every
interning stripe in turn and thrash on every write, so there is no stable value to digest. Ask
for the whole answer in one request instead.

## Fetching what an id names

```text
  →  F   a batch of ids, batched per predicate, with the listing digest for a virtual one
  ←  f   one key each, in the order asked
```

The read-path twin of a nested reference on the way in. Stored, a reference is a `FactId`, so a
row carries a number — and sigla cannot ask what it names, because a query names a fact by its
key. Five properties, each deliberate:

- **The key, not the value side.** A reference names an *identity*, and the identity is the key.
  It is also exactly the logical form the content hash is computed over and a producer nests, so
  one shape covers writing a fact, hashing it and expanding it.
- **Positional against the request**, so the reply does not send the question back with the
  answer. It carries a count, so the one fault positional pairing is exposed to is caught rather
  than mis-paired. Batch size is capped at 4096 in the decoder, so it is a protocol rule rather
  than a handler's caution.
- **Absence, not a failed stream**, for an id naming no fact: the server cannot tell an id
  lifted out of a row from one somebody typed, and the client can. A bad *predicate* id is a
  refusal, because that is a disagreement about a schema both ends hold.
- **Two kinds of absence**, because they mean opposite things: *missing* for a predicate that
  stores its facts, where a dangling id is impossible and corruption is the only explanation;
  and *unstored* for a predicate that is **answered rather than stored**, whose rows are a view
  materialised per query and may simply have moved on. Collapsing them would mean either crying
  corruption at an ordinary `db rm` or staying quiet about a damaged store.
- **Read-only is enough.** It reads facts, which every session may do. One point read each, on
  the blocking pool. It reads the store as it is *now* rather than under the query's snapshot,
  and nothing follows from that: a fact is immutable and an id is never reused, so an id that
  was in a row names the same fact under every later view.
- **Except for a virtual predicate**, where the previous point does not hold and the digest is
  what replaces it: those ids are positions in a listing that can be rematerialised, so a
  `FETCH` naming a digest that has moved is refused whole rather than resolved against rows
  that are no longer the ones the caller saw.

## The write stream

```text
  →  W   open a write stream
  ←  G   ready
  →  d   one block
  →  d   one block
  →  c   done
  ←  C   facts written, facts deduped, the id range per predicate
```

Per block, on that stream's own task and concurrently with every other stream's:

1. **decode** the block (CRC first),
2. **validate** against the embedded schema,
3. **intern** nested references bottom-up,
4. **storage-encode**, and
5. **write both column families atomically**.

The exclusion is per **key**, inside the store, so blocks from different streams proceed
together. What a block holds at the database level is only the shared half of the seal barrier:
writers hold it shared, `finish` takes it exclusive.

**Failure is per stream, not per fact.** A rejected block fails the write stream; the connection
and its other streams survive. A conflict names the offending key.

:::note A fact that interned cleanly and then conflicted stays written
Its target was legitimately named and legitimately defined, facts are immutable, and interning
is idempotent — so retrying the whole message after fixing the conflict dedups against it. What
a transaction would prevent here is a wasted row, not a wrong answer.
:::

### Blocks

The same bytes on the wire and on disk — a `COPY_DATA` payload **is** a block, and that is a
test rather than an intention.

```text
  [sync: FF × 10][magic "FJBK"][name_len u32][count u32][length u32][crc32 u32][name][payload]
   └──────────────────── 30 bytes of framing ────────────────────┘
```

- **The predicate is named, not numbered.** A number would make a fact file meaningful only
  against the database whose numbering wrote it, and make every client keep a table of ids in
  step with a server's. A name costs about six bytes *once per block*.
- **The name sits after the fixed-width fields**, so a splitter still reaches `length` at a fixed
  offset.
- **Header fields are fixed-width and little-endian**, where the payload is varints: a splitter
  must read `length` before it can trust anything else, and nothing here is ordered — the
  big-endian storage codec is answering a different requirement.
- **The CRC covers the header's own fields as well as the payload**, so a corrupted `length` is
  caught rather than used to skip to the wrong place.
- Caps: 16.7 M facts, 64 MiB payload, 64 KiB name.

### Sync markers cannot occur in a payload

Ten `0xFF` bytes are unreachable **by the encoding**, not by luck:

- a string is length-prefixed UTF-8, and UTF-8 never uses `0xF8`–`0xFF` at all;
- a varint's continuation bytes are `0x80`–`0xFF` but its final byte is below `0x80`, so a run
  ends where the varint does — and the longest possible is nine bytes;
- runs cannot join across values, for the same reason;
- the header cannot contribute one either: `count` and `length` are capped to keep a zero top
  byte, so only the checksum is free to be all-ones, and four is not ten.

So a marker appears exactly once per block, at its start, and a scan of a well-formed file finds
boundaries and nothing else. Validation (magic, then CRC) stays load-bearing for the fault it is
actually for: a torn write, a flipped bit, a file cut mid-block.

That is what makes **one file splittable**: seek anywhere, scan to the next sync, hand blocks to
workers. No reliance on per-predicate contiguity in the input, and no requirement that the
producer chose the chunking.

## The value encoding

Both directions use the transport codec, and it differs from the storage codec in every choice:

| | Storage | Transport |
|---|---|---|
| int | Marker carrying the width, big-endian minimal magnitude, negatives ones'-complemented | LEB128 varint over zigzag |
| string | Marker, escaped contents, terminator | Varint length, then the bytes |
| record | Marker, fields, terminator | The fields, concatenated. Nothing else |
| union | Marker, discriminant, payload, terminator | Varint discriminant, then the payload against that alternative's declared type |
| reference | Marker plus fixed 8 bytes | A varint branch: an id, **or the target fact** |
| names, types, arities | — | **Not sent at all** |

The last row is the design. Both peers have the schema — the handshake compares fingerprints
before data flows, and a database's schema is frozen at create — so names, order, arity and type
are things the reader already has. A union's discriminant is the one exception, because which
alternative a value took is a property of the *value*, not the schema; it is sent as a varint and
resolved against the declaration exactly as a record's field order is, and a discriminant no
alternative declares is an error on either side. That is **Avro's** model, and Avro states the consequence
plainly: binary Avro carries no type information or field names, and a record is just the
concatenation of its fields' encodings.

What is *not* borrowed is as deliberate:

- **Protobuf and Thrift** spend one to two bytes per field per message on a tag, and what it buys
  is a reader skipping fields it does not know — schema evolution between peers that never
  agreed. These peers agreed, by fingerprint, before the first byte.
- **Cap'n Proto** spends wire size on fixed-width fields to buy O(1) access with no parse. Every
  inbound fact is parsed regardless — to intern its references and re-encode it as a storage
  tuple — so there is no parse to avoid and the size is worse.

Two properties are load-bearing rather than incidental:

- **Minimal varints are enforced**, so one value has exactly one encoding. A block carries a
  CRC32 and the same encoding is used on the wire and in a file, so "the same facts" has to mean
  "the same bytes" for a checksum to be worth computing.
- **A reference is type-checked against the predicate it names**, both directions, free: a
  `Fact(p)` field can only hold a reference to `p`, and a fact id carries its predicate in its
  top bits. That catches the one corruption a bare id is prone to — an id from the right database
  and the wrong tree — which no length check or checksum would.

## What a client sends: the whole fact

```text
    src.Decl {
      module = src.Module {                    ← a whole fact, not an id
        file = src.File "store/keys.py",       ← nested again
        name = "keys"
      },
      name = "key_of", line = 12
    }
```

A reference field holds the **target fact written inline** — key and value both, to any depth —
or a `FactId` for a producer that already holds one. Ingest interns each nested fact and
substitutes the id.

**The producer keeps no book.** That is the whole reason for the shape: an indexer walking a
syntax tree knows the file when it reaches the declaration, and every id-based alternative asks
it to carry a map from every entity to an assigned identity plus an emission order that respects
one. The cost of the trade, stated: a repeated target is sent repeatedly. Block-local
back-references would compact it and are deliberately not in P0.

The **only** asymmetry between the two directions is this one: a row on its way out was read from
storage, so its references are already ids.

## Control frames

`create`, `finish` and `remove` are frames on an **ordinary stream** rather than on stream 0 —
which keeps a `create` (tens of keyspaces, tens of milliseconds each) off the reader loop, and
gives lifecycle requests the same per-stream error handling everything else has.

`list` and `describe` are deliberately **not** control frames: they read sidecars and never open
the storage engine, so they already work while a server holds every database under the root. The
remote form of `list` is a query over the virtual predicate `fjord.db.List`.

## Server obligations

- **A stream is a task.** The reader loop reads a frame, routes it, and goes back to reading.
- **One fair writer** takes a frame from each stream's queue in turn. Fairness is structural
  rather than a scheduling hope: a single shared output channel is unfair in exactly the way that
  matters, since a million-row query fills it and a second stream's four-frame answer waits
  behind all of them.
- **A chunk boundary is a real resume**, and the snapshot is released at each one.
- **Backpressure** is bounded per-stream queues plus per-connection backpressure. Per-stream
  flow-control windows are deferred.

## What is built, and what is not

| | |
|---|---|
| **Built** | The frame layer; the handshake including the schema check and the mode refusal; write streams; query streams in all four kinds; `H`/`h`; `F`/`f`; `l` and the stale-listing refusal it makes possible; in-band per-stream cancellation; a reader task per connection and one fair writer over bounded queues; control frames for create/finish/remove; stream-level failure that leaves the connection usable |
| **Deferred** | Per-stream flow-control windows |
| **Opt-in** | TCP — default-closed, and `--listen-tcp` is the only way to open one |
| **Not built** | Ingesting a fact **file** (the format is defined and the block encoding is shared; the splitter and the pipeline are not wired to a command) |

A second implementation exists and is part of the test surface: `clients/dotnet` speaks this
protocol in C#, shares no constants with the server, and its encoder is held byte-for-byte
against the Rust one over a checked-in golden. See [Clients & the viewer](clients.html).
