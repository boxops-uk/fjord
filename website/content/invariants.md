title: Invariants
description: The rules this design is checked against — fifteen engine invariants and ten operational ones, each with the guard test that pins it.
---

An invariant here is not documentation of intent. Each one names a **guard test**, guards are
written *up front* (the property statement is the spec), and a phase is finished only when the
invariants it touches are un-ignored and green.

```bash
cargo test                       # the green suite
cargo test -- --ignored --list   # the coverage ledger: guards written, not yet live
```

Two namespaces, never conflated: **`I1`–`I15`** are engine rules; **`ops-I1`–`ops-I10`** are
operational ones and are always written with the prefix.

:::note Reading a guard name
The prefix is the subsystem, not a Rust path: `codec::` is `fjord-encoding/src/tuple.rs`,
`exec::` is `fjord-engine/src/iter.rs`, `store::` is `fjord-store-fjall/src/store.rs`,
`fingerprint::` is `fjord-schema/src/fingerprint.rs`, `flatten::` is
`fjord-engine/src/flatten.rs`, and `i10_discriminants::` is
`fjord-schema/src/schema.rs`. The part after `::` is a test function — every one is
greppable. Guards named by a bare file (`i8_snapshot::`, `i13_embedded_schema::`,
`dependency_closure::`) are integration tests in that crate's `tests/` directory —
`i8_snapshot` in `fjord-store-fjall`, which since the storage seam became its own crate is
the only one that can see both implementations of it.

No guard is `#[ignore]`d: the coverage ledger (`cargo test -- --ignored --list`) lists
nothing pending. I10's was the last, and unions made it live. The next entry is already
named — [I9](#i9)'s recursive-materialisation guard, which the recursion work owes *before*
the materialisation path it measures exists, not after.

<a id="i1"></a>

### I1 — Key encoding is order-preserving

`memcmp(encode(a), encode(b)) == compare(a, b)`. What that buys, precisely: a **value-range**
scan as a bounded seek rather than a filter, and rows in semantic order with no sort. An exact
*prefix* scan needs only a canonical self-delimiting encoding and no ordering at all — so this is
a deliberate divergence whose divergent half is partly unspent, since no query lowers a range
seek yet.

It is kept because it is nearly free to hold and impossible to retrofit. What **is** spent today
is the store-level half — a scan yields rows in lexicographic key order, which resume re-seeks
against — and that is a commitment.

*The gate for any codec change.* [Storage → the tuple codec](storage.html#the-tuple-codec)

<a id="i2"></a>

### I2 — The encoding is self-delimiting

The marker byte alone says how to advance past a value; a full decode consumes exactly to
end-of-input; record nesting is bounded, so malformed bytes are an error rather than a stack
overflow. `skip` therefore needs no schema, which is what lets the scan hot loop walk to the
*n*th field of a row it holds no type for.

<a id="i3"></a>

### I3 — The marker table is frozen on disk

Marker values **and their relative order** are semantic, because a marker is the most significant
part of a value's sort key. New types take a reserved band in the right skip family; renumbering
an existing marker after data exists silently corrupts every stored key. A golden-bytes test pins
every marker so a renumber breaks loudly.

[I15](#i15) does not soften this: a database stamped `codec 1` is bound exactly as before. What
the stamp buys is that a *future* codec is a different number rather than an impossibility.

<a id="i4"></a>

### I4 — Resume equals an uninterrupted run

Resuming from a `Cursor` produces exactly the rows an uninterrupted run would, in exactly the
order.

*Guard:* a tier-3 model-based property over generated `(plan, store)` pairs **and a generated
interruption schedule** — suspend at every cut point, in every combination, and compare against a
run to completion. `exec::resume_equals_uninterrupted` runs it against the in-memory store and the
real one, where the two must also agree row for row and id for id;
`exec::the_battery_reaches_a_cut_inside_a_later_source` asserts the battery draws the shapes that
matter; and over **compiled** plans it is `flatten::resume_of_a_compiled_plan_equals_the_query`,
which draws its loop order rather than taking the identity.

**What every arm of that guard shares is a base that cannot change, and that is the shape of what
it misses.** The generators produce one store and hold it, so no case in the battery can express a
resume against a *different* database, a database still being written to, or a virtual predicate
rematerialised between requests. A property whose oracle and subject share an assumption cannot
fail on it; closing these means a **server-level** arm, not a stronger generator.

**The first two are closed.** `Cursor` now carries a **world stamp** — opaque bytes the
database-owning layer computes and the engine only compares, never interprets
([`FjallDb::reader_stamped`](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/crates/fjord-store-fjall/src/store.rs),
`fjord_store_fjall::world::BaseIdentity`). A Complete database's stamp is the content
fingerprint `finish` computed, which cannot move; a Writable database's is its live handle's
incarnation and write position at the instant the chunk's snapshot was taken, so a write that
lands between two chunks moves it and the next chunk's stamp disagrees — refused as
`FjordError::CursorWorld` rather than answered as a hybrid of two states. The incarnation, not the
write position alone, is what makes a cursor from **before a reopen** refused unconditionally: a
sequence number recovered from what a crash left durable can be lower than a live cursor's stamp,
and reasoning about what survived is exactly what a fresh nonce per `FjallDb::open` avoids having
to do. Guards: `store::reopening_mints_a_new_incarnation`,
`store::visible_seqno_moves_after_a_write_and_the_snapshot_agrees` (`fjord-store-fjall`, unit),
`iter::an_empty_cursor_from_another_world_is_refused` (`fjord-engine`, unit — the world check runs
before the empty-cursor shortcut, exactly as the plan fingerprint's does), and the server-level arm
this note used to say was missing:
`against_a_server::a_write_between_two_pages_of_a_writable_database_is_refused`, with
`paging_a_writable_database_with_no_intervening_write_still_works` as its negative control.

**The third is closed too, and it splits in two, because the virtual predicates are not alike.**
`fjord.db.List` is rematerialised per request but is otherwise a stable snapshot, so its listing
gets a **digest**, folded into the world stamp beside the base identity
(`fjord_server::session::with_listing_digest`) rather than a new cursor field: a `create`, `rm` or
`finish` between two `QUERY_PAGE` calls moves the digest, the composite stops matching, and the
same `FjordError::CursorWorld` refuses it — no new variant, no new check, because the engine still
only compares opaque bytes. Gated on **which** predicate a plan reads (`Prepared::reads_listing`),
not merely on a `Catalogue` existing: a query reading only `fjord.db.Interning` still gets one,
built from a placeholder empty listing, whose digest is a constant rather than a signal.
`fjord.db.Interning` has no such stable value — the counters are read by locking every interning
stripe in turn, not a point-in-time capture even as it happens, and they thrash on every write — so
a resume that **crosses requests** over it is refused by name instead
(`ServerError::VolatileResume`), never validated against a digest that would always disagree. The
base half's `Writable` encoding gained a length prefix on its instance id
(`fjord_store_fjall::world::BaseIdentity::to_bytes`) for exactly this composition: an unterminated
variable-length field in last position would let two different worlds encode identically by moving
a byte across the boundary between it and the listing digest appended after it.

Guards: `catalogue::two_catalogues_built_from_the_same_listing_agree`,
`catalogue::a_changed_listing_changes_the_digest`,
`catalogue::same_row_count_different_content_still_moves_the_digest` (`fjord-server`, unit — the
digest is content, not a count, so a `create` racing a `rm` cannot leave it unmoved),
`world::the_instance_id_is_length_prefixed_so_a_suffix_cannot_be_mistaken_for_more_of_it`
(`fjord-store-fjall`, unit), and the server-level arms this note used to say were missing:
`against_a_server::a_database_created_between_two_pages_of_a_listing_is_refused`,
`against_a_server::a_database_removed_between_two_pages_of_a_listing_is_refused` and
`against_a_server::resuming_a_query_over_the_interning_counters_is_refused_by_name`, with
`against_a_server::paging_a_listing_with_no_intervening_change_still_works` as the first pair's
negative control.

[Executor → the cursor](executor.html#the-cursor-bytes-and-nothing-else)

<a id="i5"></a>

### I5 — A register holds the whole row

The *field* a variable denotes lives in the **plan**, not the register — so a generator binding N
variables is N refcount bumps on one row, with no per-field decode at bind time. Fields decode
lazily at read and projection sites.

Why: at bind time you do not know which fields will be read, and a row may be bound and then
discarded when an inner loop finds no match.

One recorded narrowing: a variable a **disjunction** binds cannot always stay a lazy row, because
two branches reach a value at different paths. The rule is that it stays a row slot if every
branch binds it to a whole row of the same predicate, and otherwise each branch materialises it
into a value slot. Conjunctive plans are unaffected.

<a id="i6"></a>

### I6 — Values never enter the scan hot loop

The hot loop touches the index map only. A value is a point read, taken when a projection asks for
it. Two consequences reach the language: **a value cannot be matched on**, and the fix for
"I need to filter on this" is to put it in the key.

<a id="i7"></a>

### I7 — The executor is a defunctionalised state machine

The driver plus the frame stack are the explicit reification of a recursive `concatMap`, chosen so
execution can **suspend to bytes**. Closures and coroutines cannot: a suspended closure pins live
iterators and a snapshot.

*Do not "simplify" the driver back into recursion.* The neighbouring decision — declining a
bytecode VM — turns on token size and token stability, not on capability.

<a id="i8"></a>

### I8 — Immutable snapshot per query, released at suspend

A query reads a snapshot, and every stop releases it: suspend, cancel, terminal unwind alike. A
paused query that leaves an iterator alive is as much a leak as a suspended one.

*Guard:* cross-checks a drop probe against the storage engine's own count of open snapshots,
because "we dropped our handle" and "the engine considers it closed" are two different claims.

**Where the guarantee is *structural* is about to move, and that is the part to watch.** Today
`Executor` owns its store and `enumerate` takes `self` by value, so every exit path — done,
suspend, cancel, unwind — drops the store handle and no caller can park a live iterator. That
signature is the proof. A fixpoint runs many plans over one snapshot, so the executor can no
longer be the owner, and ownership moves to the program driver: dropping an executor then drops
a borrow, not the snapshot. The obligation becomes one the driver owes explicitly — **one base
snapshot observed by every rule and every round**, not one per rule, which would multiply the
count below; and that owner released on every exit path. It is also a correctness rule, not only
resource hygiene: "a fixpoint is a function of a frozen base" *means* one snapshot.

**A derived relation is a second kind of snapshot, and the fjall count cannot see it.** A
query-local relation is an engine-side `Arc` with no storage-engine counterpart, so a suspended
recursive program could retain every derived tuple while the existing cross-check reports zero
open snapshots and passes. The two witnesses establish different halves of this invariant and
neither substitutes for the other: keep the fjall count for the base reader, and add a drop probe
around the relation snapshot, with positive controls showing **both** live during execution and
both at zero after an answer-page suspend, a cancellation mid-fixpoint, a materialisation or limit
error, and normal completion.

<a id="i9"></a>

### I9 — The hot path is allocation-free per row

Reused scratch buffers; refcount-bump clones; inline field-offset caches that never spill. Copy
out only at escape boundaries — a suspend, a string or bytes projection, and **a tuple retained
into a derived relation**.

*Guard:* a counting global allocator asserts that scanning N and 2N rows allocates the same count
**and** bytes, with a positive control proving the allocator is linked. The caveat the project
records: the guard runs a single-level plan, and opening a level allocates — so a join allocates
once per outer row, and no guard covers that.

**The third escape boundary is named rather than excluded, and that distinction is the whole
point.** Recursion's fixpoint driver sits above `enumerate`, so nothing inside `advance` changes
— but a rule's materialisation callback runs *per rule-output attempt*, and must encode,
deduplicate and sometimes retain that output. That is a hot path in every operational sense, and
re-scoping this invariant to say the fixpoint is outside the path it measures would leave a
duplicate-heavy join allocating per attempt while `scan_is_alloc_free_per_row` stayed green.
So the rule is stated positively instead: **allocation may scale with bytes actually retained,
under the declared byte budget, and with nothing else** — not with rejected attempts, not with
duplicates, not with rounds.

Its guard does not exist yet because the relation store does not
([PLAN.md](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/blob/main/PLAN.md#recursion--query-local-relations-magic-sets-stratified-negation)
owes it before recursive materialisation lands, `#[ignore]`d up front like every other). It is
three measurements, not one, because the single-level caveat above multiplies here — a fixpoint
opens a level per rule per round:

- N versus 2N **duplicate** output attempts, retained tuples held constant: equal counts and bytes;
- N versus 2N **distinct retained** tuples: bytes scale with the retained payload and the count
  does not scale with attempts;
- repeated level opening across rounds, with the same positive allocator control.

### I10 — Union discriminants are stable and append-only

Like protobuf field numbers: each alternative has an explicit discriminant, assigned once, never
reused, new alternatives appended. Frozen the moment union-typed data is written.

Why it is a one-way door: a union value is stored tagged by its discriminant, so discriminants
derived from position or from sorted names would **silently renumber** existing ones and
misinterpret every stored value. This is why the schema DSL has syntax for writing the number
down.

The guard is four checks, because "a renumber is rejected at load" is unimplementable under
[I13](#i13) — a database's schema is frozen at create, so at load there is only ever one schema
and nothing to compare it against. What together means what I10 means: **within one schema**
every alternative has a tag and no two share one (`reject/missing-discriminant`,
`reject/duplicate-discriminant`); **identity** — renumbering a tag moves the fingerprint while
permuting the declaration does not
(`i10_discriminants::a_renumbered_tag_moves_the_fingerprint_and_a_permuted_declaration_does_not`);
**`schema diff`** — every union edit is Breaking, appending an alternative included
(`fingerprint::changing_a_union_is_breaking_appending_an_alternative_included`); and **decode** —
a stored tag no alternative declares is an error, never a mis-read of whichever alternative sat
nearby (`tuple::an_undeclared_discriminant_is_refused_rather_than_misread`).

<a id="i11"></a>

### I11 — A `FactId` is stable, unique, never reused

Assigned once at ingest; a snowflake, with the predicate in the high 24 bits and a per-predicate
sequence in the low 40. Uniqueness across predicates is structural rather than enforced.

A physical id, **not** cross-database identity. It is also the prerequisite for the resume
integrity check: a saved key that still resolves to the saved fact is only meaningful if ids do
not move.

<a id="i12"></a>

### I12 — Both maps are written atomically, and a key names exactly one fact

Two halves, and the second is the one that took a mechanism.

**Atomicity:** a fact is never half-present. A key with no entity makes a value projection return
nothing; an entity with no key is invisible to every query — silent, and undetectable without
checking both directions.

**Write-once:** writing the same key twice overwrites the key row and strands the first fact's
entity. Held for a long time by there being one writer thread — a property no test can observe —
and now held by **per-key exclusion striped by `hash(predicate ++ key)`**, which needs no lock
ordering because interning is bottom-up and critical sections are never nested.

*Guard:* a bijection check over generated writes, a crash test that aborts a child process
mid-write, and N threads racing to intern one key.

<a id="i13"></a>

### I13 — The schema is embedded and frozen at create

The canonical schema and its fingerprint are embedded at `create` and immutable for the database's
lifetime. Every ingest is validated against that copy, by **subset containment**.

What it buys: an artifact is self-describing and portable, a handshake can compare fingerprints
before any bytes flow, and a server can serve one store root's databases from *their own*
schemas rather than from whatever it was started with.

Its boundary condition, stated: it says nothing about a *reader* older than the database it opens.
That mismatch is between a query and a database rather than between two schemas on disk, and
lockstep rebuild of the reader is the answer.

<a id="i14"></a>

### I14 — A derived bind is a pure function of the fact bindings

Which is what makes it recomputable on resume instead of saved — the general form being the
**recompute rule**: in an immutable database a store read is a pure function of its inputs, so
anything determined by the bindings and the frozen base may be recomputed rather than saved.

*Guard:* a derive step is recomputed across **every** cut point, and the rows match an
uninterrupted run.

<a id="i15"></a>

### I15 — A database says which format wrote it

A twelve-byte stamp in a metadata keyspace, with `codec` and `storage` versioned separately,
checked at open. An unreadable database is **refused**, and one holding facts with no stamp at all
is refused rather than adopted.

## Operational invariants

Explained in full on the [Operations](operations.html) page.

| # | Statement |
|---|---|
| `ops-I1` | Single-**process** store ownership; no silent connect→open fallback |
| `ops-I2` | Complete = immutable; every write refused at session establishment |
| `ops-I3` | Finish ordering: durable first, status flip last |
| `ops-I4` | Reproducibility; identity is `hash(canonical schema, base facts)`; conflicts reject, order-independently |
| `ops-I5` | One write funnel — one *pipeline*, not one thread |
| `ops-I6` | Session modes declared at open, resolved once against status |
| `ops-I7` | The filesystem is the catalog |
| `ops-I8` | Derivation is phased: create → ingest → derive → finish |
| `ops-I9` | No cross-database anything in P0 |
| `ops-I10` | No in-database auth; the transport is the trust boundary |

## The anti-patterns each one forbids

Every item here looks reasonable and breaks a specific invariant. The project keeps this list
because the dominant failure mode is a large, mostly-correct change whose 10%-wrong part is
expensive to find.

| Don't | Breaks |
|---|---|
| Materialise a full result set | The streaming contract; and aggregation cannot be made suspend-free |
| Decode fields eagerly at bind | [I5](#i5), [I9](#i9) |
| Fetch a value inside the scan loop | [I6](#i6) |
| Hold an iterator across a suspend | [I8](#i8) |
| Rewrite the driver as recursion | [I7](#i7) |
| Write one map without the other | [I12](#i12) |
| Renumber markers or discriminants after data exists | [I3](#i3), [I10](#i10) |
| DNF-expand a disjunction across conjuncts | Exponential blow-up; and the plan shape the machine has |
| Reshape the machine for an "additive" feature | The rule that a construct may add a source, a test or a residual — never a `Step` |
| Use a hash map for record fields | Deterministic order is a codec requirement |
| `unwrap` on decoded data | Errors, not panics, on data paths |
| "Restore" the single writer to fix an ordering problem | [I12](#i12)'s mechanism — and a conflict rule that picks a winner breaks `ops-I4` |
