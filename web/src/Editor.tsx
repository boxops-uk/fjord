/**
 * A textarea with the real tokens painted underneath it.
 *
 * The overlay is what makes this the lexer's output rather than a picture of
 * it: the caret, the selection and the wrapping all belong to the textarea, and
 * every coloured span behind it is one token's `span` sliced out of the source.
 * The two only stay aligned because the token stream covers the source
 * exactly — which is what `token_spans_reproduce_the_source_exactly` asserts,
 * for both languages.
 *
 * Used for the query and for the schema, because the difference between them is
 * *which lexer produced the tokens* and nothing else a page can see.
 *
 * The wavy underline is drawn from the **diagnostics**, not from the token
 * classes. A byte the lexer refused is one kind of fault and gets a class of its
 * own; an unknown predicate, a type mismatch and a range restriction are the
 * others, and they are perfectly good tokens — so a squiggle that came from the
 * class only ever appeared under a bad string.
