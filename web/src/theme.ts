/**
 * **Fjord, as a theme** — neutral ground, one accent, three code colours.
 *
 * The page already carries a great deal of semantic colour: a badge per plan
 * step, a wash for the row the machine is standing on, a band across the bytes a
 * scan is walking, an error, a yield. So the *ground* stays out of it. Every
 * surface, line and ink here is a neutral at one hue (250°) and a chroma small
 * enough that nobody could name it — what a reader sees as colour is only ever
 * something the engine said. The neutral hue is 250° — cool by a hair, which
 * reads cleaner on a screen than a dead grey.
 *
 * **Designed in OKLCH, written as hex,** and what is chosen is the distance
 * between the steps rather than the values. Light surfaces at 96.5 / 98.5 / 100
 * and dark at 13.5 / 16 / 20.5, so a card lifts off the page and a toolbar sits
 * into it either way up; inks at 22 / 46 / 66 and 92 / 72 / 55; lines at 90 / 80
 * and 28 / 38. Each value carries the OKLCH it came from, because that is the
 * number worth editing.
 *
 * Hex rather than `oklch()` for one reason: the accent is a *seed* the theme
 * reads to derive `--color-on-accent` and the accent inks, and a form it cannot
 * parse gives a magenta eyebrow and no warning.
 */

/**
 * **Three hues, and the rest is ink.**
 *
 * A token palette drifts into a rainbow one hue at a time — violet keywords,
 * teal numbers, amber constants — and then nothing in it means anything. These
 * are the three distinctions sigla actually has: *the language* (its keywords
 * and the variables they bind), *what is being read* (a predicate, a type), and
 * *a literal*. Fields, punctuation and plain text are ink at three weights; a
 * comment is the quietest of them.
 *
 * Both schemes hold one lightness per role — 46–52% light, 80–84% dark — so a
 * keyword and a string differ in hue rather than in weight.

    // sits at exactly the weight a highlighted row does, and only its hue says
