# The interactive site

The design book with the engine itself running in it. React and Vite, with
`fjord-engine` compiled to WebAssembly — so a page that shows what the lexer
does is *asking the lexer*, not paraphrasing it.

**The pages are `website/content/`**, imported raw and parsed here rather than
copied: one book, two renderers. **This is the one CI publishes** — to
<https://boxops-uk.github.io/fjord/>, and as the docs bundle a release carries.
The generated site in [`website/`](../website/README.md) still builds, as the
copy that needs no toolchain and as the renderer this one is held to, and its
reading order — `website/nav.json` — is the one this sidebar renders. What this
site adds is that the demos are the engine: a `:::demo` block in the content is a
running lexer, parser, typechecker, planner, executor or database table. Most are
editable in the page; a guided run fixes its query so every transition can carry
an exact explanation.

There is also a **workbench** at `/playground`: every view of one query at once,
which is the thing a paragraph cannot hold. A demo hands its query to it through
the URL.

## The design system

The components are [Astryx](https://github.com/facebook/astryx)
(`@astryxdesign/core`): the shell, the navigation, the outline, the command
palette, the code blocks, the tables, the callouts, the dialogs, the toolbars and
the controls. It ships pre-built CSS, so there is no build plugin — `main.tsx`
imports `reset.css` and `astryx.css`, and `<Theme>` at the root of the
application injects the theme.

**The palette is `src/theme.ts`**, and it is deliberately quiet. The page
already carries a great deal of semantic colour — a badge per plan step, a wash
for the row the machine is on, a band across the bytes a scan is walking, an
error, a yield — so every surface, line and ink is a neutral at one hue and a
chroma nobody could name. What a reader sees as colour is only ever something
the engine said.

Code gets **three hues and the rest is ink**: the language (keywords, and the
variables they bind), what is being read (a predicate, a type), and a literal.
Fields, punctuation and plain text are ink at three weights, and a comment is
the quietest of them. The badges draw from the same three, because a `seek` chip
and a string literal being different greens is the kind of thing nobody reports
and everybody feels.

Both schemes are **designed in OKLCH and written as hex**, and what is chosen is
the *distance* between the steps rather than the values: light surfaces at 96.5 /
98.5 / 100 and dark at 13.5 / 16 / 20.5, so a card lifts off the page and a
toolbar sits into it either way up; inks at 22 / 46 / 66 and 92 / 72 / 55. Each
value carries the OKLCH it came from. (The method is the one `boxops`' token set
documents. The accent is a hex rather than an `oklch()` string because the theme
*reads* it to derive the accent inks — a form it cannot parse gives a magenta
eyebrow and no warning.)

The frame fills the viewport and the regions scroll independently, which is what
keeps the reading order and the on-page outline in place while a page moves under
them. The nav **collapses** rather than resizing — twenty-three names is not a
width worth choosing — and the outline drops below 1200px rather than squeezing
the measure. The workbench's database panel is the one region that *is*
resizable, because which side deserves the width depends on what a reader is
doing.

What stays custom is what the design system has no opinion about, because it is
about this engine: the editor that paints a textarea with the lexer's own tokens,
the parse and lowered trees, the plan, the register file, and the database table
with a scan's range shaded across its bytes. Those keep their CSS in `app.css`,
written in design tokens rather than hex.

`CodeBlock` takes a `tokenizer`, which is where the two meet: a `sigla` or
`schema` block on a page that has the module is tokenized by **the engine's
lexer**, and falls back to the rules from `website/assets/app.js` until it does.

```bash
../scripts/build-wasm.sh   # or: npm run wasm
npm install
npm run dev                # http://localhost:5173
npm run smoke              # builds, serves, and drives it in a real browser
```

`npm run wasm` writes `src/wasm/`, which is **not** checked in — a binary in git
is a binary somebody has to trust, and the build is one command. Without it the
page says so and points at the script; it does not fall back to a highlighter
written in JavaScript, because that is the thing being replaced.

## Demos, in the content

A demo is a fenced block in the Markdown, so it lives where the paragraph that
needs it lives:

```markdown
:::demo plan
N where code.Decl {file = F, name = N, line = _}; F = code.File P; P = "src/u"..
:::
```

Kinds: `lex` · `parse` · `types` · `plan` · `run` · `store` · `schema`. The body
is a query; a `---` line above it makes the part before it the schema the query
is written against, for a demo that is about compiling rather than running:

```markdown
:::demo plan
schema test { predicate Foo : { id : int, name : string } -> string }
---
X where test.Foo {id = 1, name = X}
:::
```

Add `guided` after `run` for a read-only query with its plan, executor and
relevant database rows visible together, plus a description panel that follows
the transport one transition at a time:

```markdown
:::demo run guided
N where F = code.File "src/lib.rs"; code.Decl {file = F, name = N, line = _}
:::
```

With no schema of its own a demo uses `schemas/demo.sigla`, which is the only one
with a database behind it — `run` and `store` demos need rows, so they use it.
`website/build.py` understands the same block and renders the source with a note
that it is live here, so the generated site stays honest rather than showing an
answer that would go stale.

## What is where

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `src/App.tsx` | the router: a path is a page, and `/playground` is the workbench |
| `src/book/markdown.ts` | the book's dialect, as `website/build.py` renders it — a tree of blocks, because every one of them is a component |
| `src/book/PageView.tsx` | that tree, rendered: a heading is a `Heading`, a table is a `Table`, a callout is a `Banner`, a fence is a `CodeBlock`, a demo is the engine |
| `src/book/content.ts` | the pages, globbed raw from `website/content/`, parsed once each; the search index is every page's headings, built when somebody first searches |
| `src/book/Layout.tsx` | the shell: the bar, the reading order, the page, and one click listener so a link in the prose is a navigation |
| `src/book/Code.tsx` | a fenced block — a `CodeBlock` whose tokenizer is the engine's own lexer once a demo on the page has brought the module in, and the fallback rules until then |
| `src/book/highlight.ts` | those fallback rules, ported from `website/assets/app.js`, for the languages neither the engine nor the design system knows |
| `src/book/Search.tsx`, `router.ts`, `mode.ts` | the command palette over every heading, routing, and the light/dark choice |
| `src/theme.ts` | the book's palette as an Astryx theme, and the syntax theme the lexer's token classes map onto |
| `src/demo/Demo.tsx` | a demo: the engine, the view the block asked for, and an editor over the query |
| `src/engine.ts` | the module, loaded once and shared — *demanded* by a demo, merely *observed* by everything else, so a page of prose does not fetch a compiler |
| `src/wasm.ts` | loading the module, and the TypeScript shape of the JSON it answers |
| `src/Playground.tsx` | the workbench: the source, the samples, the accordion of views, and the database beside them |
| `src/SchemaPane.tsx` | the schema, as text — the only form a browser can hold one in, since `import` resolution reads files — painted by the schema language's own lexer |
| `src/LoweredView.tsx` | the lowered tree as the query's own shape: a head, then one section per statement |
| `src/PlanPane.tsx` | the plan: each step's text is the engine's own (`print::steps`), with the structure a reader counts around it |
| `src/RunPane.tsx` | the debugger: the machine's state folded from the changes each step carries |
| `src/Transport.tsx` | the controls that move a run — any navigation pauses it, and the buttons keep their size as they change state |
| `src/DataTable.tsx` | the database, with the scan's range shaded across it — the panel the plan's numbers are about |
| `src/run.ts` | one fold, read by both panels, so they cannot disagree about which row the machine is on |
| `src/playback.ts` | play — one transition every fifth of a second, which is about as fast as a register can be read |
| `src/Editor.tsx` | a textarea with the real tokens painted underneath it — used for the query and the schema, since the only difference is which lexer produced the tokens |
| `src/TokenTable.tsx`, `src/TreeView.tsx` | the two views — the second walks the arena from its root, which is already in reading order |
| `src/span.ts` | what the cursor is on, and the rule every view highlights by: a node lights up **its subtree** and the bytes it covers, never the path above it — that is what the indentation already shows |
| `src/book.css` | the only custom CSS on a page: the two class names the *book* uses in its own authored HTML, scoped so they cannot collide with a component's |
| `src/app.css` | the workbench's panels — the parts the design system has no component for — in design tokens |
| `smoke.mjs` | the end-to-end check — it drives the built bundle in Chrome, over both halves |

The token colours are keyed on `TokenClass`, which the Rust side decides
(`fjord_inspect::tokens`). A page styles what the language says a token *is*; it
never re-decides it. Adding a token to sigla therefore reaches the browser
without anyone editing a regex here — which is the whole argument for compiling
the engine rather than reimplementing it. The same holds for the tree: a rule
added to `grammar.llw` does not compile until `fjord-inspect` names it.

The sample queries, the schema and the facts all come from the **module**, not
from here: `fjord_inspect::SAMPLES` over `schemas/demo.sigla` and the demo
database, with `every_sample_compiles_clean` and `every_sample_answers_what_it_says`
asserting each one in the Rust suite — down to how many rows it answers, because
a demo query that returns nothing demonstrates nothing. That is not tidiness. The first version of this page invented
its own samples, and **every one of them was missing the head a query requires**
— the lexer tokenised them happily, and it took the parse view to notice.

## Two renderers, one book

The smoke check compares them page for page — headings, tables, code blocks,
callouts and demos — against `website/site/`, when that has been built. A dialect
that drifts is a page that reads differently depending on which copy of the site
you found, and the two parsers are in different languages, so nothing but a check
keeps them together.

## Serving it

A page is a path, so a host has to answer every path with the application.
`npm run build` writes **a document per route** — `storage.html` and
`storage/index.html`, the two shapes a static host resolves an extensionless path
through — plus `dist/404.html` for a path nothing knows about. The copies are the
point: a fallback alone renders the right page and answers **404**, which makes
every page but the root a 404 to a link preview or a crawler, and the smoke check
asserts the documents exist rather than trusting the fallback.
`SITE_BASE=/fjord/ npm run build` sets the base for a site served from a
subdirectory.

**The base is compiled in**, which is why CI builds the bundle twice and the two
are not interchangeable: `SITE_BASE` taken from the repository's name for the
copy GitHub Pages serves, and the default `/` for the tarball a release carries,
which is for a server with the site at a root. The `site` job builds the module,
runs the smoke check against a real Chrome, and only then bundles — so what
deploys is what was driven.
