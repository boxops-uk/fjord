**The corpus.** `dotnet/runtime` at `c99188c2f97`, its whole `src/` tree indexed by
`clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Indexer --syntax-only --jobs 8`: 32,710 files, **18,176,899
facts** across 22 predicates, 1.8 GB on disk, 4,613 s to build. This is the first
database in the project's history large enough for a scaling question to mean anything,
and every number below is from it.

**The instrument.** `cargo run --release --example engine -- --store <instance>` —
S1 (`--layer executor`), S2 (`--layer compile`), S3 (`--layer store`). In-process, no
tokio, no wire, no server. Each workload is run once unmeasured to fix its row count and
per-step examined counts, and every timed run must reproduce both or the run aborts.

**The host.** 8 cores, 32 GB, kernel 6.8.0-1061-aws, release build. Note this **corrects
[§5 of the phase plan](#appendix-the-eight-hypotheses-read-out-of-the-code-before-anything-was-measured)**, which says 4 cores / 15 GB / 5.8 GB
free disk; the box now has 8 / 32 / 185 GB. The disk constraint that shaped the plan is
gone. Ratios travel, absolutes do not.

## 1. Paging costs one seek per page — and on a freshly-ingested database that seek can cost 600 µs

**Hypothesis F7, answered, and it turned out to be two findings.**

The server computes at most `CHUNK_ROWS = 256` rows per turn, then suspends to a
bytes-only cursor and resumes ([chapter 5](../website/content/executor.md)). Nobody had measured
what that costs, and it is paid on every query. Running the same plan straight through
against the same plan suspended every 256 rows, both bounded to 100,000 rows:

| Workload | straight | paged | overhead | per page | · snapshot | · resume |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| scan files | 13.85 ms | 14.24 ms | +3% | 3.1 µs | 0.1 µs | 4.9 µs |
| scan modules | 14.88 ms | 14.79 ms | +0% | — | 0.1 µs | 4.2 µs |
| scan lines | 38.31 ms | 42.07 ms | +10% | 9.6 µs | 0.1 µs | 9.5 µs |
| scan refs | 46.35 ms | 110.36 ms | **+138%** | 164.1 µs | 0.2 µs | 161.8 µs |
| **scan decls** | 42.56 ms | 352.99 ms | **+729%** | 796.0 µs | 0.3 µs | **790.3 µs** |

The three dotted columns take a page apart, and they settle where the cost is: **the
snapshot is free** (0.1–0.3 µs, so [I8](../website/content/invariants.md#i8)'s release-at-suspend
discipline costs nothing) and **all of it is `Executor::resume`** replaying one seek per
level.

But a resume seek should not cost 790 µs, and a 200× spread between predicates in one
database is not a property of the executor. S3 measures the same seek with the machine
taken away — open a scan at a key sampled from the middle of the keyspace, take one row:

| Keyspace | rows | tables | seek, as ingested | seek, after `major_compact` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src.File` | 32,710 | 1 | 3.6 µs | 3.0 µs |
| `src.Module` | 36,192 | 1 | 2.8 µs | 3.0 µs |
| **`src.Decl`** | 888,177 | 1 | **646.6 µs** | **4.7 µs** |
| `src.SearchByName` | 888,177 | 1 | 4.3 µs | 8.8 µs |
| `src.Ref` | 4,879,151 | 5 | 160.1 µs | 10.4 µs |
| `src.Line` | 8,583,810 | 4 | 7.0 µs | 3.4 µs |

`src.Decl` and `src.SearchByName` hold **exactly the same number of rows** in the same
database, each in a single table, and one seeks 150× slower than the other. Ruled out by
measurement, not by argument:

- **not row count** — the two slow ones are 888k and 4.9M; the fastest is 8.6M
- **not table count / LSM overlap** — `src.Decl` is one table, and so is `src.SearchByName`
- **not position** — seek cost is flat across the keyspace (627 µs at row 0, 698 µs at row 393,504)
- **not stale versions visible to iteration** — `approximate_len` equals the distinct row count
- **not key width** — `src.File` has the widest keys (88 B) and is the second fastest
- **not leading-byte cardinality** — a synthetic control with the same row count and key
  length, varying only how many rows share a leading prefix (1 → 5,000), moves the seek
  by 3.1 → 3.3 µs. Nothing.

What does settle it: **copy the real keys and values, unchanged, into a fresh keyspace,
sort, flush and compact** — same data, differently built.

```
keys.2 (src.Decl): 888,177 rows, key bytes min 17 avg 53 max 5907
  as ingested : tables=1 disk=50,639,866   seek 623.4 µs
  rewritten   : tables=1 disk=33,962,226   seek   3.4 µs      ← 183×
keys.4 (src.Ref) : 4,879,151 rows
  as ingested : tables=5 disk=159,824,868  seek 156.1 µs
  rewritten   : tables=2 disk= 82,628,952  seek   3.4 µs      ←  46×
```

So it is **the state ingestion leaves the LSM in**, not the data and not the engine. A
major compaction of the whole index confirms it end to end:

- **22.9 s** to compact all 44 keyspaces, single threaded
- **1,593,452,874 → 728,344,678 bytes** — the store is 46% of its ingested size
- and F7 collapses to a **uniform +7% to +20%, 4–12 µs per page**, which is the real
  answer to what paging costs

**Nothing in the tree compacted.** `grep -rn major_compact crates/ src/` was empty, and
`Catalog::finish` — the one operation that declares a database immutable forever — wrote
an identity hash and a sidecar and never touched the LSM. So the artifact that
[operations §5](../website/content/operations.md) says gets copied per reader process was
shipped in the shape a random write order left it.

### Fixed: sealing now merges

`FjallDb::compact` merges every tree, and `seal` calls it after the durability sync and
before the identity walk — before the walk so the fingerprint is computed over the tree
that ships, before the sidecar so the byte count it records is the artifact's rather than
the ingest's. Two guards in `fjord-store/tests/finish.rs`:
`sealing_merges_every_tree_into_one_table` (which flushes three batches first and asserts
it had something to merge, because at test sizes it otherwise would not) and
`merging_does_not_change_the_identity`, which is `ops-I4` — compaction rewrites the bytes
and must not move the fingerprint.

Measured through the real command, on the 18M-fact index:

```
$ fjord --data-dir … finish code
sealing code — merging trees, then computing identity
sealed code: 18176899 facts, 853606008 bytes, identity 0xa0a07894b275e6a0
        4m16s
```

:::note The identity is pre-rename and will not reproduce
`0xa0a07894b275e6a0` was computed when the canonical form's domain separator was
`aperture-schema-v1`; it is `fjord-schema-v1` now, so every fingerprint in the project moved.
The fact and byte counts are unaffected — they are over the data — but do not try to reproduce
this number without re-indexing. Same for `0x462058b7b0671d29` in §15.
:::

- **1.7 GB → 853 MB**, and that is now the `bytes` the sidecar reports, so `describe` says
  how big the artifact is rather than how big the ingest was.
- **Every seek 4.2–4.6 µs**, measured on the sealed database: `src.Decl` 646.6 → 4.2 µs,
  `src.Ref` 160.1 → 4.3 µs, `src.Line` 7.0 → 3.3 µs.
- Of the 4m16s, the merge is ~23 s measured separately; the rest is the identity walk,
  which `finish` always did.

**And the merge is not a cost — it is a saving.** The same `finish` on an identical copy
with the merge removed ran for **30 minutes of CPU without completing**, against 4m16s
complete. The reason is the identity walk itself: it expands every reference to the base
fact it names, which is one point read per reference, and point reads are exactly what an
unmerged tree makes expensive. So merging first makes the walk that follows cheaper by more
than the merge costs. That figure is a lower bound — the run was stopped, not finished —
but the direction is not in doubt, and the *old* `finish` was the slow one.

`finish` was quick on small databases and is now minutes on large ones, so it prints a
line to stderr before it starts rather than explaining afterwards. `ops-I3` is unchanged
and the crash guard still passes: the sidecar flip is still the last durable act, and a
crash during the merge leaves the pre-merge tree and a Writable database — the same answer,
and the same re-runnable command, as a crash during the sync.

**Still open: a Writable database is never merged.** A long-lived one that is queried while
it grows — which is what the server's `create`/write-stream path produces — pays the
unmerged seek cost on every page, forever, because it never reaches `finish`. Nothing here
addresses that, and it should not be addressed by compacting on a timer without measuring
what a merge costs a concurrent writer first.

**Watch this one, because it is the finding that changes other numbers.** Every capacity
figure taken against a freshly-ingested database — including S6's population sweep, when
it is run — is measuring an unmerged LSM unless it is sealed first, and the effect is not
uniform across predicates, so it distorts a workload *mix* rather than scaling it. `finish`
before measuring is now the whole of the fix, and every rung above S3 should say which side
of it the numbers came from.

---

## 2. A join's cost is decided by key field order — and that order is the schema's to choose

Not on the hypothesis list, and the largest effect measured anywhere in this phase.

A predicate's seekable prefix is its key's leading fields, and the physical key order is
**the order the schema declares them in**. So:

- `src.Line` is declared `{file, line}` → the key leads with the reference
- `src.Decl` is declared `{line, module, name}` → the key leads with the **line number**

The same join shape over the two, from the S1 catalogue:

| Workload | rows | examined | examined/row | per row | plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `join on a leading field` | 8,583,810 | 8,616,520 | 1.004 | 393 ns | `src.File* → src.Line` |
| `join on a middle field` | 2,000 (capped) | 112,548,829 | **56,274** | 26.0 ms | `src.Module* → src.Decl*` |

```
L where F = src.File _;   src.Line {file = F, line = L}      -- seeks
D where M = src.Module _; src.Decl {module = M, name = D}    -- rescans src.Decl per module
```

The second cannot narrow, so it reads all 888,177 declarations once per module — 32
billion rows to completion, which is why the instrument caps it. `--profile` already tells
you (`full scan` on the inner step); nothing warns you when you write it.

This is also the most plausible cause of finding 1's *distribution*: a predicate whose key
leads with a low-cardinality int is written in an order uncorrelated with its key order, so
its tree takes the most garbage. The two slow seeks were `src.Decl` (leads with `line`) and
`src.Ref` (leads with `at.col`).

### The order is declared, not derived — checked three ways

It is tempting to read this as alphabetical, because in `src/code_index.rs` every record's
fields *are* in alphabetical order. They are not in that order because anything sorts them:

1. **`flatten`** walks the schema's own `PredicateTy::Record` slice by index
   (`FieldPath::field(idx)`) and looks each query field up **by name**
   (`flatten.rs:2341`). Nothing sorts; the slice's order is the key's order. `ty.rs:695`
   says as much in a comment — *"both sides are sorted, but the schema's order is Phase
   8's to guarantee, not this pass's to assume."*
2. **A test already pins it.** `fjord-store`'s `the_encoding_order_is_the_declared_order`
   (`fact.rs:538`) builds a predicate declaring `z` before `a` precisely because *"the
   schemas here happen to be sorted by name, and nothing in the codec depends on it"*.
3. **Directly.** Two schemas over the same two fields, differing only in declaration order,
   compiled against the same four queries:

   ```text
   declared {apple, zebra}      test.Rev {apple = "a", zebra = X}  → seek[apple = "a", zebra = _]
                                test.Rev {zebra = 1,   apple = X}  → scan
   declared {zebra, apple}      test.Rev {apple = "a", zebra = X}  → scan
                                test.Rev {zebra = 1,   apple = X}  → seek[zebra = 1, apple = _]
   ```

What makes the built-in schema alphabetical is a **convention it imposes on itself**:
`code_index.rs`'s `every_record_lists_its_fields_in_sorted_order` asserts it, and the
file's own commentary states the rule as if the machine required it — *"A record's fields
are sorted by name and that order is the key order, so the only way to choose what a
predicate narrows on is to choose what its fields are called."* That last clause is not
true: the order can be chosen directly, and only that test forbids it here.

**Costed fix, and it is much cheaper than a design change.** Declare `src.Decl` as
`{module, name, line}` — one line in `code_index.rs` — and retire or invert the sorted-order
test, whose stated purpose (a swapped field list silently answering a different question)
is served better by asserting the *intended* order per predicate than by asserting sorted.
[I3](../website/content/invariants.md#i3)/[I1](../website/content/invariants.md#i1) freeze what is already
written, so this is a re-index rather than a migration — cheap now, at one index; not cheap
later. Worth settling before [Phase 8](../PLAN.md)'s schema DSL fixes how a key is written
down, since the DSL will have to say whether declaration order is load-bearing.

### Fixed: the order is declared per predicate, and the guard says so  ✅

`src.Decl` is `{module, name, line}` and `src.Ref` is `{to, file, at}`, with `at` itself
`{line, col}`. The sorted-order test is replaced by `KEY_ORDER`, a table of every stored
key as its **flat** field path list, asserted against the schema — so a swap still fails,
and the guard can no longer enforce an accident. It also refuses a record value side,
which nothing has yet and which would need the same decision.

The claim that this is one line was optimistic by four files: the key order is stated
independently by the C# indexer, the C# demo and the Rust golden test, and a `WireFact`'s
key is **positional**, so every fact builder moved with the declaration. That the two
clients then produced byte-identical blocks again, from schemas neither one shares, is the
check that the reorder is consistent rather than merely compiling.

**One stale comment made this harder to see, and may have caused it.** `src.SearchByName`
exists, per its own comment, because *"a declaration's key begins with its module, so
`src.Decl {name = "encode"..}` reaches the name only after the scan has opened"*. The key
no longer begins with `module` — `line` was added ahead of it, alphabetically — so the
predicate that exists to work around `src.Decl`'s key order is documented against a key
order `src.Decl` no longer has.

## 3. The executor's own floor is ~330 ns/row, and it is flat in database size

The scaling curve, which [the phase plan](#appendix-the-eight-hypotheses-read-out-of-the-code-before-anything-was-measured) calls the one
result that could invalidate the target outright. It does not.

| Workload | rows | per row | rows/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| scan files | 32,710 | 401 ns | 2,495,088 |
| scan modules | 36,192 | 385 ns | 2,597,765 |
| scan decls | 888,177 | 432 ns | 2,313,953 |
| scan refs | 4,879,151 | 434 ns | 2,306,705 |
| scan lines | 8,583,810 | 360 ns | 2,779,286 |

**262× the rows, and ns/row moves by less than 20% — with no trend.** Underneath it, S3's
raw `FactStore::scan` is 233–426 ns/row over the same range, so the executor adds roughly
25–50% to what fjall charges, and cross-rung agreement holds (S3 rows/s > S1 rows/s
everywhere).

Two more from the same table:

- **`X where X = 42` costs 327 ns** — a plan with no steps, one row, zero rows examined.
  That is the executor's fixed cost, against `loadgen`'s ~200 µs end-to-end floor: **the
  engine is under 0.2% of what a query costs over a socket**, which is the same conclusion
  `breakdown` reached from above and is now bracketed from below.
- **A `Source::Fetch` costs ~2.6 µs/row** — `scan decls` at 432 ns against the same scan
  plus a fetch at 3.0 µs. S3 prices a bare point read at 1.7–2.1 µs, so the fetch is
  essentially the point read and the machine adds little. Projecting the fetched fact's
  *reference* field costs exactly what projecting its *string* costs (3.0 vs 3.0 µs), so
  the fetch is the whole price.

---

## 4. ~~A fact's value cannot be read by a query~~ — **wrong, and withdrawn**

Found while writing the catalogue, and it bounds what any of these numbers can cover.

> `src.Line` is `{ file, line } -> string` and holds 8,583,810 line texts — 133 MB, the
> largest predicate in the index. No sigla query can read one. There is no `->` in the
> grammar, and every spelling tried is a parse error; a query binds *key fields* only,
> and a bare `X = src.Line _` binds the fact reference.
>
> The immediate consequence for this phase: **F5 (a chunk has no byte budget) cannot be
> exercised from the query side at all.** The widest row the catalogue can build is three
> narrow fields off a nested key, which is nowhere near the 64 MiB `MAX_PAYLOAD` that F5
> is about. F5 stays open, and needs either a value-reading query or a synthetic corpus
> of very wide keys.

**`.value` reads the value side, and always has.** It compiles to `Project::Value`, in
process and over the wire:

```
sigla> :plan L.value where L = src.Line _
  r0 <- src.Line scan
  head r0.value

$ fjord query code '{n = D.name, k = D.value} where D = src.Decl _' --limit 5
K      N
def    key_of
class  CodecError
…
```

The corpus said so before this finding was written —
`"X.value where X = test.Foo _"` is `Supported`, annotated *"`.value` is the fact's value
side — Project::Value"*. What is deferred is **matching** on a value
([I6](../website/content/invariants.md#i6)), not reading one. The `->` spellings tried here are
indeed parse errors; the mistake was generalising from them without trying the field
access, and no plan was printed to check the conclusion against.

Two consequences. **F5 is not blocked** — a query over `src.Line`'s value side builds
rows as wide as the corpus has text, which is the wide-row generator this finding said
did not exist. And serving a file's source text out of the database is a seek plus one
value read per row, which is what makes a code-search file view possible at all
([phase 11](../website/content/clients.md)).

*Kept rather than deleted, struck through: a findings file that quietly edits its
mistakes is one nobody can calibrate against.*

---

## 5. Compilation is 4–14 µs, and linear in the query's size

S2, against F3 — *no plan cache; every query is parsed, typechecked, flattened and
reordered afresh.* Over the S1 catalogue that costs **4.4 µs** (`X where X = 42`, no
steps) to **13.6 µs** (the widest projection); the three-level join compiles in 11.4 µs.

Against generated queries of k conjuncts over one predicate:

| conjuncts | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| compile | 5.0 µs | 7.2 µs | 12.4 µs | 23.4 µs | 43.8 µs | 83.3 µs |

**Linear** — ~2.5 µs of fixed cost plus ~2.5 µs per conjunct, with no term that grows
faster. It is also independent of corpus size, as it must be: the compiler never touches
the store.

So F3 is confirmed as *true* and reclassified as *small*: against the ~211 µs per-query
floor the phase plan records for `loadgen`, a plan cache would buy back **2–7%**. Real,
measurable, and the smallest term in the budget — not worth building against finding 1.

---

## 6. A population of readers: capacity is ~67 q/s for this mix, and it does not collapse

S6, against the **sealed** 18.2M-fact index (finding 1 matters: an unmerged database is a
different measurement), 8 cores, generator on the same box. Each client is a connection and
a thread drawing from the standard lopsided mix — 80% point lookup, 15% small scan, 4% full
scan, 1% whole-database join — with no think time, so this is the saturation curve.

| clients | point p50 | point p99 | small scan p50 | full scan p50 | join p50 | achieved | CPU (gen / server) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 193 µs | 342 µs | 1.8 ms | 70.9 ms | 5.20 s | 17 q/s | 23% (5 / 17) |
| 8 | 938 µs | 3.7 ms | 4.7 ms | 184 ms | 11.4 s | 86 q/s | 86% (21 / 65) |
| 32 | 2.6 ms | 19.7 ms | 19.4 ms | 819 ms | 43.0 s | 69 q/s | 97% (22 / 75) |
| 128 | 3.0 ms | 18.0 ms | 81.2 ms | 4.23 s | 124.5 s | 68 q/s | 99% (23 / 76) |
| 256 | 6.7 ms | 29.7 ms | 158.8 ms | 8.54 s | 178.4 s | 67 q/s | 99% (23 / 76) |
| 512 | 18.3 ms | 64.6 ms | 305.9 ms | 15.65 s | 231.6 s | 69 q/s | 99% (23 / 76) |
| 1024 | 42.7 ms | 100.4 ms | 571.3 ms | 28.84 s | 315.3 s | 66 q/s | 99% (23 / 76) |

**Zero errors at every level.** Four things worth taking from it:

- **Throughput plateaus at ~67 q/s from 32 clients to 1024 and stays there.** A 32× increase
  in offered load moves achieved throughput by 3%. It saturates; it does not collapse.
- **The cheap query stays cheap.** Point-lookup p99 goes 19.7 ms → 100.4 ms across that same
  32× range, and p99/p50 stays between 2.3 and 3.5 — it tracks p50 rather than detaching
  from it, which is the difference between a queue that is fair and one that is starving
  somebody. At 1024 clients a point lookup answers in 42.7 ms while the join it is sharing
  the server with takes 315 s: **a factor of 7,400**, and the small query is on the right
  side of it. That is the chunked resumable executor doing what I4/I8 built it for, now at
  18M facts rather than 240k.
- **The expensive class queues linearly and fairly** — the join's p50 rises in step with the
  client count (43 s at 32, 315 s at 1024), which is what no-starvation looks like from the
  other side.
- **The bottleneck is the server, not the instrument.** At saturation the generator burns
  23% of the machine and the server 76%, steady across the whole sweep — so the plateau is
  the server's, with roughly a 30% correction available if the load ever moved off-box.

### What that is in users

Capacity is a **rate**, and users are a rate divided by how often each of them asks. Two
measurements pin the arithmetic. At one client the machine spends 0.108 core-seconds per
query; at saturation, 0.118 — the same number from both ends, so this mix costs about
**0.11 core-seconds a query end to end**, ~0.09 of it server-side.

Per class, unloaded, the service times above give the shape:

| class | share of queries | service time | share of the CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| point lookup | 80% | 193 µs | 0.3% |
| small scan | 15% | 1.8 ms | 0.5% |
| full scan | 4% | 70.9 ms | 5.1% |
| **join, whole db** | **1%** | **5.20 s** | **94%** |

**The mix decides capacity, by two orders of magnitude.** Drop the 1% join and the same
eight cores serve roughly 1,900 q/s instead of 67. So a bound on concurrent users is only
meaningful with the mix beside it:

| mix | capacity | users at 10 s think | users at 30 s think |
|---|---|---|---|
| as measured (1% whole-db join) | ~67 q/s | ~670 | ~2,000 |
| no whole-db join (4% full scans) | ~1,900 q/s | ~19,000 | ~57,000 |

Checked against a think-time sweep rather than left as arithmetic — 512, 1024 and 2048
users each thinking 10 s between queries:

| users | offered | achieved | point p50 | point p99 | CPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 512 | 51 q/s | 41 q/s (81%) | 1.7 ms | 12.3 ms | 49% |
| 1024 | 102 q/s | 61 q/s (59%) | 2.6 ms | 16.5 ms | 83% |
| 2048 | 205 q/s | 64 q/s (31%) | 4.4 ms | 20.7 ms | 92% |

2048 connected users are **cheap** — 20.7 ms at the p99 a person actually notices, on a box
that is not full. What they cannot do is all ask at once.

One methodological trap, recorded because it will mislead somebody: **achieved-below-offered
is not saturation here.** At 512 users the server was at 49% CPU and still "missed" 19% of
the offered rate, because a user waiting 100 s inside a join is not issuing anything. When a
class's service time exceeds the think time, offered load is fiction and the honest reading
is the CPU column beside it.

## 7. F1 is real, and what it bounds is how long a *connection* lives — not how many users are served

The hypothesis: `read_loop`'s `streams: HashMap<u32, StreamHandle>` has no removal path, and
the client never reuses a stream id, so a connection issuing many queries accumulates parked
tasks. Nothing in the repo could measure it — `soak`'s mix means a client manages ~1,700
queries before a run ends, which turns out to be under the noise.

So: **one connection, 200,000 point lookups, the same key every time.**

```
                            RSS         threads
  before                    215 MB      13
  15 s in  (~80k queries)   501 MB      15
  30 s in (~160k queries)   781 MB      16
  45 s in (200k, finished)  911 MB      16
  60 s in (idle, open)      911 MB      13     <- stops the moment queries stop
  after close               904 MB      13     <- and is not returned
  round 2 on a NEW conn     1,412 MB    13     <- another 200k adds another 508 MB
```

**~3.5 kB retained per query**, growth strictly proportional to queries issued and flat the
instant they stop. It cannot be the block cache: the query is a point lookup for *one key*,
repeated, so there is nothing new to cache.

**It is retained for the life of the connection, and no longer.** Two independent checks,
because the first reading — RSS not falling on close — is exactly what a leak *and* an
allocator holding freed pages both look like.

*Successive long connections asymptote.* Three 200k-query connections in turn, each opened
after the last had closed:

| | RSS | added |
|---|---|---|
| start | 243 MB | |
| round 1 | 892 MB | +649 MB |
| round 2 | 1,306 MB | +421 MB |
| round 3 | 1,341 MB | **+35 MB** |

A leak adds the same every round. This reuses what the previous connection freed — the
process keeps a high-water mark rather than climbing.

*And a realistic population never gets near it.* S7 below: 145,582 queries over 50 minutes
across connections that live one segment each, and RSS moved 237 → 245 MB. **58 bytes per
query**, against 3,500 on one long-lived connection.

So the exposure is **the busiest single connection**, and what it sets is a high-water mark:

| client shape | queries per connection | retained while open |
|---|---|---|
| `fjord query`, one per process | 1 | nothing |
| `soak`'s users, reconnecting | ~45 | ~160 kB |
| a pooled connection held open at 67 q/s for an hour | 240k | **~840 MB** |

A connection pool is exactly the shape that hits the bottom row, and it is the one to size
RAM for. What this is *not* is a reason to restart on a schedule: the ceiling is per
connection and it comes back.

**Costed fix — since built, and *not* re-measured.** The fix was to remove a stream from
`read_loop`'s map when its task completes, and it is in
`crates/fjord-server/src/session.rs`: a handle whose task has ended has a closed `Sender`, so
the map is swept on that rather than on a second channel, behind a doubling watermark
(`MIN_SWEEP_AT = 32`) that keeps it amortised — a connection genuinely holding many live
streams does not sweep on every frame.

**So the mechanism is gone and the number is not retired.** Nobody has re-run this
instrument since, so the honest statement of finding 7 today is: the cause was found, a fix
addressing it has landed, and *the 3.5 kB per query has not been measured at zero*. Anyone
sizing RAM for a pooled connection should re-run this before trusting either figure, and
`crates/fjord-viewer`'s pool is exactly the shape that would show it.

What is still missing to verify it cheaply is the phase plan's own task 10f: a
`live stream tasks` counter would turn "RSS grew" into "N tasks are live", and would have
made this a five-minute test rather than the afternoon it took — which is also why it is
still an afternoon to close.

**F2 is refuted.** A cancel landing mid-chunk on the most stride-tripping query available —
56,274 rows examined per row produced — returns a clean end (256 rows drained), sends no
error frame, and leaves the connection usable for the next query. Tested through the client
API and through `fjord query --limit`; both are clean.

## 8. Steady state holds: fifty minutes, 145,582 queries, no drift

S7. A sub-knee rate on purpose — 256 users thinking 5 s, offering 51 q/s against a measured
capacity of ~67 — run in twelve four-minute segments so drift shows up as one segment
differing from the last rather than as an average over an hour.

| segment | 1 | 4 | 8 | 12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| point lookup p50 | 768 µs | 742 µs | 728 µs | **710 µs** |
| point lookup p99 | 6.2 ms | 6.2 ms | 5.5 ms | **5.6 ms** |
| small scan p50 | 4.4 ms | 4.5 ms | 4.3 ms | 4.3 ms |
| full scan p50 | 186.5 ms | 192.6 ms | 188.8 ms | 186.0 ms |
| achieved | 48 q/s | 48 q/s | 48 q/s | 48 q/s |
| server RSS | 237 MB | 243 MB | 243 MB | 245 MB |
| server threads | 68 | 76 | 76 | 79 |

Nothing moves. Latency at every percentile is flat or slightly better at the end than the
start, throughput is identical to the query across all twelve segments, and zero errors.
The two things that do creep are worth naming: **RSS +8 MB** (finding 7's per-connection
accumulation, at the rate short-lived connections produce) and **threads 68 → 79**, which is
the blocking pool settling rather than growing without bound — it moved 8 in the first
quarter of the run and 3 in the remaining three quarters.

**A paused-reader population costs latency and no throughput.** The same segment run again
with 400 extra clients that ask for everything and then stop reading:

| | baseline | +400 stalled |
|---|---|---|
| point lookup p50 / p99 | 710 µs / 5.6 ms | 812 µs / 6.3 ms |
| small scan p50 | 4.3 ms | 5.0 ms |
| full scan p50 | 186.0 ms | 212.0 ms |
| achieved | 48 q/s | 48 q/s |
| errors | 0 | 0 |

**+10–14% latency, 0% throughput.** Bounded per-stream queues plus the fair writer mean a
stream that will not drain is a stream that waits, holding neither a worker nor a blocking
thread — which is what the design says and what this measures.

What this does *not* cover, and would need a longer run: fjall compaction under a write
load, since this database is `Complete` and nothing compacts. The **disconnect storm** the
phase plan also asks for is finding 10, and it did not go so quietly.

## 9. F4 answered: encoding a row costs 1.5×, and the wire above it costs another 3.6×

The prediction was that per-row framing dominates above ~100k row/s. Splitting the wire
path in two — the executor alone, then the executor plus exactly what the server does per
row (`to_value`, `rows::to_wire`, `encode_value` into a fresh buffer, `session.rs:863`) —
puts most of the cost above the encoder rather than in it:

| workload | executor alone | + project & encode | tax | over the wire (1 client) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| scan files | 2,476,335 row/s | 1,637,046 row/s | 1.5× | 461,000 row/s |
| scan decls | 2,275,416 row/s | 1,515,723 row/s | 1.5× | |
| scan lines | 2,759,872 row/s | 2,121,751 row/s | 1.3× | |
| project record | 2,293,536 row/s | 1,093,153 row/s | **2.1×** | |
| wide row | 2,110,274 row/s | 1,032,222 row/s | **2.0×** | |

So of the ~5.4× between the executor and the socket, **1.5× is the row encoding and 3.6× is
everything above it** — one `DATA_ROW` frame each, the outbound mutex, the `Notify`, the
socket, and the client's own decode. F4's mechanism is confirmed as significant but
misattributed: the encoder is not the dominant term, the framing and transport around it
are.

The two workloads that cost twice rather than 1.5× are the two that **build a record per
row**. Projection shape, not row count, is what makes a row expensive to hand out.

## 10. A client that disconnects mid-result leaked, permanently — the one that mattered  ✅ fixed

Not on the hypothesis list. Found by building S7's disconnect storm: clients that connect,
ask for a whole predicate, read two rows and vanish while the server is still producing.

```
530,717 connect-query-vanish cycles in 110 s   RSS  1,057 MB →  8,247 MB
515,926 more, on the same server, in 60 s      RSS  8,257 MB → 14,989 MB
```

**Linear, not asymptotic** — the second storm added the same per cycle as the first, which
is what separates a leak from a high-water mark. ~13.4 kB per abandoned query, never
returned. At the 8,400 cycles/s a single 16-thread client sustains, that is **65 MB/s**: a
32 GB server is dead in about eight minutes, and no privilege is required to do it.

Threads and file descriptors both return to their idle values afterwards, so nothing is
holding a task or a socket. It is memory alone.

### Three arms, because "abandoned" and "large" and "churning" are three different claims

Each from a freshly started server, 60 s, same 16 threads, same box:

| arm | cycles | RSS after | per cycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| point lookup, drained to the end | 1,309,617 | 129 MB | 8 bytes |
| **32,710-row result, drained to the end** | 2,556 | 143 MB | high-water: **flat at 149 MB** when run for 5× longer |
| **32,710-row result, abandoned after 2 rows** | 502,564 | **6,879 MB** | **13.4 kB, linear** |

So it is not connection churn — 1.3M connect-query-close cycles cost 10 MB. It is not result
size — the *same* 32,710-row query, read to the end, plateaus at 149 MB and stays there
through a nine-minute run. It is **abandonment**: ending the connection while the server
still has rows to send.

This is also the most common client behaviour there is. A `Ctrl-C` at the shell, a crashed
consumer, a proxy timing out, `--limit` on a page the user never scrolls — all of them are
this. It is worth saying that the *graceful* cancel path is clean (finding 7's F2 result):
`connection.cancel` ends the stream properly and leaks nothing. What leaks is the socket
disappearing without one.

### Fixed — and the obvious fix was the wrong one

Instrumenting the server settled where the memory was: **live stream tasks, climbing without
bound.** 383,121 abandoned connections left **113,336 tasks alive** while live *sessions* sat
at 14 — so connections were tearing down correctly and their tasks were not.

The obvious cause is the one F1 named: `StreamHandle` holds a `CancellationToken`, and
dropping a token does not cancel it, so nothing tells an in-flight query that its client has
gone. Adding `Drop for StreamHandle { self.cancel.cancel() }` is right and is kept — a doomed
query otherwise runs to completion, queueing a blocking-pool job per chunk for a result
nobody will read. **It also fixed nothing:** 106,215 tasks still stuck.

A counter per await site said why. Every stuck task was parked in the same place:

```
diag: conns 122951 · streams 37783 · sessions 0 || recv 0 prepare 0 desc 0 chunk 0 send 37783
```

**All of them in `Outbound::send`, waiting for queue room.** The writer task is the only
thing that ever frees a slot. When the client vanishes, the socket write fails, the writer
ends *on the spot* — and `close()` notified `work` (which the writer watches) but never
`room` (which producers watch). Every stream still answering parked on a queue nobody would
ever drain, holding its chunk, its plan and a database handle for the life of the process.

Two lines of fix, in `outbound.rs` and `session.rs`:

- **`close()` wakes the waiters** — `room.notify_waiters()` alongside the existing `work`
  notification. `notify_waiters` deliberately stores no permit; a producer arriving later
  finds `closed` under the lock instead.
- **`send()` registers its wait under the lock**, via `Notified::enable()`. A `Notified` does
  not register until first polled, so creating it after releasing the lock left a window in
  which a `close` could wake every waiter and miss this one.
- **The writer announces its own death** — the pump calls `close()` when `outbound_run`
  returns, rather than leaving it until `read_loop` notices, which covers a half-closed peer.

Measured, same probe, same box:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 3 storms, 781,399 abandoned queries | +7 GB each, linear | **119 → 141 → 144 → 144 MB** |
| live stream tasks afterwards | 113,336 | **0** |
| per abandoned query | 13.4 kB, permanent | ~58 bytes, asymptotic |

**Guard tests, at two levels.** In `outbound.rs`,
`closing_releases_producers_waiting_for_room` fills a stream's queue, asserts the producer
is genuinely parked, closes, and requires it to be released *and* refused — with a timeout,
because the regression is a hang rather than a failure. Reverting `notify_waiters` makes it
fail in 5 s. A second test covers the arrive-after-close path, which `notify_waiters` cannot
wake by design.

Above that, `tests/a_vanished_client.rs` asserts the thing a *server* owes rather than the
mechanism: sixteen clients ask for everything, read two frames, and drop the socket; live
stream tasks must return to zero and the server must still answer in full. Two things it
learned the hard way, both recorded in the file:

- **One client is not enough.** The defect needs the producer to fill its queue before the
  reader notices EOF, and with a single client that lands the wrong way about 40% of the
  time — the first version of this test passed against the unfixed server. Sixteen makes a
  clean sweep about a one-in-two-million event; against the unfixed server three runs
  stranded 7, 13 and 11 of 16.
- **The client has to read before it vanishes.** A socket dropped the instant after the
  query is written takes the query with it: the server never reads the frame, never starts,
  and there is no in-flight work to strand. An earlier version did exactly that and passed
  while measuring nothing — the counters said `queries_started = 0`.

**What did not change**: 100 paused readers still block rather than erroring (a stalled
client's connection is alive, so its producer waits, re-checks `closed`, and waits again),
throughput on both workloads is unchanged, and the whole suite is green at 608.

## 11. The code-search workload: ~6,000 q/s, and the product's own traffic is nothing like `soak`'s

`examples/codesearch.rs`, written against a stated product: search by name, results paged to
50–100, and **no search term means no query** — so the UI never asks this database for an
unbounded scan. Every query is a prefix seek into `src.SearchByName`, whose key leads with
`name` for exactly this reason. Terms are sampled from the corpus and truncated, so a
type-ahead burst is short prefixes matching thousands and a considered search is a long one
matching a few.

| class | weight | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| typeahead | 70% | 2–4 char prefix, one query per keystroke |
| considered search | 20% | 5–12 char prefix |
| search + locations | 8% | the same, rendering where each hit is — a fetch per row |
| open symbol | 2% | clicking a hit: exact name |

### Capacity

Saturation, page 50, no think time, against the sealed 18.2M-fact index:

| in flight | achieved | typeahead p50 | typeahead p99 | CPU (generator / server) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 3,580 q/s | 2.3 ms | 5.5 ms | 88% (33 / 54) |
| 32 | 4,676 q/s | 6.7 ms | 20.8 ms | 98% (41 / 57) |
| 128 | 6,094 q/s | 24.5 ms | 47.7 ms | 98% (42 / 57) |

**~6,100 q/s, against 67 q/s for `soak`'s generic mix — ninety times more.** All of that
difference is the one class `soak` has and a search UI does not: a query with no bound on
what it reads.

The generator is now a co-equal consumer — 42% of the box against the server's 57% — so this
understates the server. Per query the *server* spends **0.75 ms of CPU**, which is
**~10,700 q/s** if the load came from another machine. Treat 6,000 as measured and 10,000 as
the thing to confirm with a second host.

### In users

| users | think | achieved | typeahead p50 | p99 | CPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 512 | 3 s | 170 q/s | 2.0 ms | 45.9 ms | 6% |
| 2,048 | 3 s | 674 q/s | 3.1 ms | 145.7 ms | 16% |

2,048 users at a 3-second think time is **16% of this box**, at a p50 of 3.1 ms. Saturation
would be around **13,000–14,000 users at 3 s**, or ~45,000 at 10 s. For tail latency rather
than throughput, half of that is the number to plan around: **~6,000 users per instance at
3 s think**, which leaves headroom for the p99 to stay tens of milliseconds.

One caveat on those tails: at 2,048 users the generator is 2,048 OS threads on 8 shared
cores, and a p99 of 146 ms at 16% CPU is mostly its own scheduling. The p50 is the trustworthy
column at high user counts.

### Page size is a dial, not a free choice

The obvious guess — that a page below `CHUNK_ROWS = 256` is free, since the executor computes
a whole chunk anyway — is **wrong**, and worth knowing before picking 50 or 100:

| page | rows returned | typeahead p50 | achieved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 48 | 6.1 ms | 5,118 q/s |
| 100 | 93 | 7.1 ms | 4,489 q/s |
| 256 | 226 | 10.5 ms | 3,274 q/s |
| 500 | 417 | 14.4 ms | 2,508 q/s |

Roughly linear in rows *delivered*, because the dominant per-row cost is not the executor's —
it is the framing, socket and client decode of finding 9, and cancelling stops paying it.
**Page 100 costs 12% of throughput against page 50**; page 256 costs 36%. Bigger pages are
cheaper per row (245k row/s at 50, 1.05M at 500) and dearer per query.

### Two things this workload does *not* suffer

- **No leak.** Paging cancels *gracefully*, which is finding 10's clean path. Across ~900,000
  paged queries the server went 756 → 792 → 797 MB — a high-water mark, asymptotic, not the
  13.4 kB-per-query bleed an abandoned result causes. The disconnect leak still matters for a
  web tier (a browser that goes away mid-request), but normal paging does not trigger it.
- **No head-of-line problem.** Without a whole-database query in the mix there is nothing for
  a cheap query to queue behind, which is why p50 barely moves until the box is full.

### The blocker: find-references cannot be served

The second thing anyone wants from code search, and it is not answerable:

```
{f = R.file, l = R.at.line} where src.SearchByName {name = "OCTET_LENGTH", to = D};
                                  R = src.Ref {to = D}

  src.SearchByName        1
  src.Ref           4,879,151   full scan          →  2.21 s, for ONE declaration
```

`src.Ref`'s key is `{at, file, to}` — `at` first, `to` last — so a lookup *by target* cannot
seek and reads every reference in the database. For a common name like `Parse`, which many
declarations share, it is that scan once per declaration: the query did not return three rows
in five minutes.

This is finding 2 landing on the product's most valuable query. The fix is the same one and
it is cheap **now**: declare `src.Ref`'s key `{to, file, at}` so the target leads. That is one
line in `code_index.rs` plus a re-index — and it is a different, worse conversation once
somebody's index is the one in production.

**Done** — see finding 2's fix. `src.Ref` leads with its target, so the negation form of
the same question (`!src.Ref {to = D}`, "what does nothing use") compiles to
`seek[to = r0#, file = _, at = _]` where it read the whole predicate before. The number
above is not re-measured: it needs a re-index of `dotnet/runtime`, which is hours and must
not run while anything else is being measured. What is checked is the plan, which is where
the 4.9M-row scan came from.

---

## 12. Ingest is 5.2k facts/s, and the write path was never the reason — three quarters of the work was re-reading, and half the wall clock was the producer waiting

The one number [glean-capabilities §2.3](../docs/glean.md) said "nothing in
`bench/FINDINGS.md` yet attributes". Attributed here. **Not an S-rung measurement** — there is no
write-path instrument yet — but read off counters the indexer already reports, on a 25M-fact
`dotnet/runtime` index: a larger run than §1's `--syntax-only` 18.2M-fact one, reaching the build
and declaration layers as well as the source layer.

| | |
|---|---|
| Facts created | **25.0M** |
| Facts *interned* to create them | **94.9M** — so **73.6% of the work was re-reading something already present** |
| Point reads per intern | **2** (`keys` for the id, `entities` to compare the value) |
| Wall clock | **4,828 s** ⇒ **5.2k facts/s** |
| Inside the blocking `Write` call | **2,255 s** — 47% of the run |
| Per block (`--batch 4000`) | **368 ms** |

Derived from those two timings rather than measured separately: ~6,100 blocks, ~24.5M top-level
facts, ~92 µs per top-level fact, ~24 µs per intern, ~12 µs per point read.

**Two mechanisms, and the bigger one is not in the database.** The `Write` call happened while the
walk held `Indexer._gate`, so during those 2,255 s the other seven walker threads were blocked:
the write path was serialised **with** the producer rather than alongside it. That is a pipelining
defect in the client and it is worth about 1.9× on its own (`4,828 → ~2,600 s`, `5.2k → ~9.7k
facts/s`) by handing full blocks to a writer thread behind a bounded queue.

The second mechanism is the 73.6%. It is genuine work, not waiting, and it is what a
[lookup cache](../crates/fjord-store/src/lookup_cache.rs) and skipping the `entities` read on
key-only predicates (22 of 27) remove.

**What the arithmetic then says, and it is the finding that mattered.** After pipelining, the two
sides are nearly balanced — ~2,255 s of server intern against ~2,573 s of walk. So the single
writer is *not* today's binding constraint, and cutting its work further buys headroom rather than
wall clock. **The reason to make it parallel anyway is not throughput** — it is that the write-once
half of [I12](../website/content/invariants.md#i12) was being held by there being one thread rather than by a
mechanism, and that only becomes visible when you go looking for the throughput. See
[Phase 12](../PLAN.md).

Two things to fix in how this was measured, before it is measured again:

- **`Writing` stops being comparable to wall clock** once the writer overlaps the walk. The number
  that answers "is the writer the ceiling?" is then `Queueing` — time producers spent blocked on a
  full queue — and it did not exist when this was taken.
- **A hit-rate counter is not optional.** A cache that is not hitting is indistinguishable from
  one that is absent, except in a line that prints hits and misses.

---

## 13. The write rung: committing is 41% of interning, and the cache is worth 23% of a resolve pass

The instrument finding 12 said was missing. `cargo run --release --example ingest` writes a
**synthetic** corpus shaped like the source layer of the built-in schema — a reference nests
a declaration nests a module nests a file — in process, no tokio, no wire, no server. Four
fanouts set the interns-per-fact ratio, which is the quantity interning's cost is decided
by; the default sits at 4.63 against the real index's 3.8.

40 files × 2 modules × 20 decls × 5 refs = 9,720 facts, 45,000 interns, best of 2:

| layer | ms | facts/s | interns/s | reads/fact | cache |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `commit` | 30.2 | 321,968 | — | 0.00 | — |
| `create` | 58.2 | 166,914 | 772,750 | 1.00 | 78.4% |
| `dedup:warm` | 26.5 | — | 1,698,325 | 0.00 | 100.0% |
| `dedup:cold` | 34.4 | — | 1,309,655 | 0.22 | 78.4% |
| `block:create` | 76.7 | 126,792 | 587,001 | 1.00 | 78.4% |

The rows are there to be subtracted:

- **Committing is 23.9 ms of `create`'s 58.2 ms — 41%.** `create` resolves and writes;
  `dedup:cold` resolves the identical corpus against a cold cache and writes *nothing*. The
  difference is 9,720 `put_fact` calls, each its own fjall batch through one global journal
  mutex. This is the number [12f](../PLAN.md) exists for, and it is larger than expected.
- **The cache is worth 7.9 ms of a 34.4 ms resolve pass — 23%.** `dedup:cold` starts with an
  empty cache and reads the LSM once per distinct key; `dedup:warm` answers all 45,000 from
  memory. Both do zero commits, so nothing else differs.
- **Block decode is 18.4 ms per pass, ~32% on top of `create`.** The transport codec is not
  free at these rates, and it is the one term the read ladder already had an opinion about
  (finding 9's 1.5× row encoder, in the other direction).
- **`reads/fact` is 1.00 on both create rows**, which is
  [12c's guard](../crates/fjord-ingest/tests/against_a_real_store.rs) priced rather than
  counted: one live `keys` read per distinct key across four levels of nesting, where 4.63
  interns per fact would otherwise mean 4.63 reads.

Two independent estimates of commit cost agree: the `commit` floor writes 9,720 scalar keys
in 30.2 ms, and `create − dedup:cold` puts the same 9,720 commits at 23.9 ms. Different
key shapes, ~25% apart, same order — which is the cross-check that says neither row is
measuring something else.

**After the striped merge frontier (12d), on the identical command.** `create` 58.2 → 59.0 ms,
`dedup:warm` 26.5 → 27.5 ms, `dedup:cold` 34.4 → 34.8 ms, `commit` 30.2 → 29.8 ms. So per-key
exclusion costs **1–4% single-threaded**, and the largest share lands on `dedup:warm` — the row that
is nothing but hash-and-look-up, with no LSM read and no commit under it. That is the signature the
theory predicts, since what the frontier adds to a single writer is exactly one FNV pass over the
key. `commit` is unchanged, as it must be: `put_fact` is below the funnel and takes no stripe. The
run-to-run spread here is ~1 ms, so read these as "a few percent", not as three significant figures.

**With `--per-block` (12f), on the same command.** `create` 61.1 → **48.4 ms**, 159,026 →
**200,861 facts/s** — a 21% cut, and the *committing* term halves rather than vanishing (25.8 →
12.7 ms). Staging is not free: the rows are still built and a pending map is still filled; what goes
away is 9,720 journal-mutex acquisitions collapsing into one. So the honest headline for the flag is
**~20% off a create pass**, not the 41% that "committing is 41% of interning" invites — the 41% is
what committing costs, not what batching removes.

One reading artefact worth knowing: the `cache` column shows **0.0%** on a `--per-block` create.
Nothing regressed. A staged block answers its own repeats from the batch's pending map, which is
consulted *before* the stripe cache, so the cache is never asked and its hit counter never moves.
The two modes' cache columns are not comparable, and the dedup rows — which stage nothing — are.

**What this is not.** It is not finding 12 re-measured: that needs the 25M-fact
`dotnet/runtime` index rebuilt, which is hours and must not run while anything else is
being measured. It is a *baseline on a synthetic corpus*, and its value is that the terms
are now separable — a facts/s number can be attributed to committing, resolving, reading or
decoding instead of to "the write path". Also absent: the wire and the server. The rung
stops below them deliberately, and the layer that adds them is what finding 12's 47%-inside-
`Write` figure belongs to.

## 14. The indexer can now use many write streams, and on a small corpus it should not

Phase 12 made a database take as many writers as it has streams; `clients/dotnet` can now
ask for them (`--writers n`, one connection each, since the C# client issues streams
sequentially over one socket and cannot multiplex). Measured on this repository's own
`clients/dotnet` tree — 16 files, 12,382 facts, `--syntax-only`:

| | 1 writer | 4 writers |
|---|---|---|
| throughput | **4,703 facts/s** | 4,251 facts/s |
| queueing (walk blocked on a full queue) | 0.1 s | **0.0 s** |
| gate wait (walkers blocked on each other) | 0.8 s | 0.9 s |
| created / deduped / blocks | 12,382 / 32,211 / 26 | **identical** |

Two things, and the second is the reason the default is 1.

**It is correct.** Four writers against one database produce exactly the counts one writer
does — which is the wire-level version of what
`writer_count_and_write_order_do_not_change_the_database` asserts in process, now with a
real server, real sockets and a real Roslyn walk in front of it.

**It is not faster here, and could not have been.** `queueing` was already 0.1 s of a
~2.6 s run, so the writer was never the ceiling; adding three more can only add
connections, handshakes and scheduling. Most of that is fixed cost and would disappear at
scale — but "would" is not a measurement. The number that says to raise `--writers` is
`queueing`; while it is near zero, one writer is the right answer.

**What this does not measure — now measured, in [§15c](#15c-the-ingestion-upgrade-is-157-and-concurrent-writers-cross-over-at-16000-files).**
A corpus of 26 blocks told us nothing about a corpus of six thousand, and it was wrong about
the sign: on the full corpus four writers *do* pay, but only past ~16,000 files, and they
cost 20–30% before that. `queueing` on a real index is 1,019.4 s of 3,977.7 s at one writer.
`--commit-per-block` is still unmeasured.

---

## 15. Fjord and Glean over one corpus and one producer: the walk is 30%, the tail is 45%, and Glean's write path is 3.5× cheaper

**What was measured.** `dotnet/runtime` at `c99188c2f97`, its whole `src/` tree, four runs
of the same producer: `clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Indexer --syntax-only --jobs 8`, the line
table on, `--batch 4096`. Three write into Fjord, one writes Glean JSON batches
(`--glean-out`, [§Into Glean instead](../clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Indexer/README.md)) which
`glean create -j 8 --finish` then loads. **One walk, two sinks**, so what differs between
the last two rows is the database and not the indexer.

| | pre-upgrade | 1 writer | 4 writers | Glean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| walk + ingest | 5,048.2 s | 3,977.7 s | 3,751 s | 3,738 s emit **+ 579 s load** |
| **ex-tail** (see below) | 3,493 s | 2,230 s | 1,811 s | **1,110 s** + 579 s |
| ex-tail throughput | 7,156 f/s | **11,204 f/s** | **13,795 f/s** | 22,511 f/s emit-only |
| seal | not run | 327 s | 344 s | inside the load |
| `writing`, summed over writers | 2,395.5 s | 2,037.7 s | 5,081.9 s | **107.5 s** |
| `queueing` (walk blocked) | did not exist | **1,019.4 s** | 271.4 s | 1.5 s |
| gate wait / held | did not exist | 7,608 / 1,282 s | 3,256 / 644 s | 926 / 284 s |
| facts stored | 25,012,490 | 25,012,490 | 25,012,490 | **25,012,490** |
| on disk | 2.3 GB unsealed | 3.2 GB | 3.2 GB | **886 MB** |
| intermediate | none | none | none | 6.6 GB of JSON (264 B/fact) |
| peak RSS | — | 16.2 / 2.2 GB | 20.0 / 1.7 GB | 24.3 GB emit, 1.16 GB load |

### 15a. Both databases hold the same facts, and that is the load-bearing check

25,012,490 facts on each side, and **all 27 predicates agree stored-for-stored** —
`Decl` 888,177, `Assembly` 5,349, `Package` 142, `PackageRef` 435, `Implements` 32,238,
`Override` 89,415, `Attribute`/`AttributeOf` 163,640, and so on. The producer queued
25,046,499, so 34,009 top-level keys were duplicates; both systems deduplicated exactly
those, from 94.9M interning attempts, without either being told which.

The two Fjord runs also seal to the **same identity, `0x462058b7b0671d29`** (pre-rename — see
the note in §1) — one writer and four, over a real server and four real sockets. That is
`writer_count_and_write_order_do_not_change_the_database` at 25M facts rather than in
process, and it is `ops-I4` meaning what it says.

### 15b. The tail: one generated file is 45% of the wall clock and contributes 365 facts

`src/tests/JIT/jit64/opt/cse/hugeexpr1.cs` — 24 MB, 89,162 lines, one gigantic expression —
sits at position 28,819 of 32,710 in path order. `IndexTree` emits its line table
immediately and then walks `DescendantNodes()` with a semantic lookup per name; on one
enormous expression that pass runs for **~29 minutes and resolves almost nothing** (912,615
unresolved names in that directory alone). The other seven walkers finish everything else,
the file counter parks at 32,709, and the run waits.

| | pre-upgrade | 1 writer | 4 writers | Glean emit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tail | 1,555 s (31%) | 1,747 s (44%) | 1,940 s (52%) | 2,628 s (70%) |

**Every facts/s figure ever quoted for this corpus is diluted by it, including
[§12](#12-ingest-is-52k-factss-and-the-write-path-was-never-the-reason--three-quarters-of-the-work-was-re-reading-and-half-the-wall-clock-was-the-producer-waiting)'s
5.2k.** It is also not constant: it grows with heap pressure (its share tracks peak RSS
across the four runs), so it is the *worst* thing to leave inside a measured window. What to
do about it is a corpus decision, not a code one — quote ex-tail, or exclude `src/tests`,
which is CoreCLR's test suite rather than library source. Ex-tail is used above and should
be used from here on.

### 15c. The ingestion upgrade is 1.57×, and concurrent writers cross over at ~16,000 files

Ex-tail, one writer: **7,156 → 11,204 facts/s, 1.57×**. Handing the block to a writer
thread is the whole of it; the corpus, the counts and the dedup are identical.

Four writers are **1.23× again** (13,795 f/s) — but the totals hide what happened, and the
matched-file-count curve is the finding:

| files | 1 writer | 4 writers | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4,000 | 127 s | 167 s | **0.76** |
| 8,000 | 289 s | 367 s | 0.79 |
| 16,000 | 579 s | 655 s | 0.88 |
| 24,000 | 1,434 s | 1,132 s | **1.27** |
| 32,000 | 2,192 s | 1,768 s | 1.24 |

**Concurrency costs 20–30% while the tree is small and pays 19–27% once it is deep**, and
the crossover is around 16,000 files / 11M facts. Early on, interning is cheap, the writer
was never the ceiling, and three more of them only add connections and server-side
exclusion; late on, each intern is a real LSM read and four writers overlap that I/O.
[§14](#14-the-indexer-can-now-use-many-write-streams-and-on-a-small-corpus-it-should-not)
guessed the small-corpus half of this from 26 blocks and was right; this is the other half,
and together they say the writer count wants to be **adaptive rather than a flag**.

`queueing` — the number §12 and §14 both said nobody had for a real index — is
**1,019.4 s of 3,977.7 s at one writer**, and four writers cut it to 271.4 s while
inflating summed `writing` 2.5× (2,037.7 → 5,081.9 s). The stall did not vanish; it moved
from the client's queue into the server's interning path.

### 15d. What the Glean run separates that no Fjord run could

The emit's sink costs 107.5 s over 6,128 blocks (17 ms each, against 330 ms for a block
through the socket) and its `queueing` is 1.5 s, so **the emit ex-tail is the walk's own
cost: 1,110 s.** Everything else in a Fjord run is interning that failed to hide behind
it:

- **the walk is ~30% of a one-writer run** (1,110 s of 3,977.7 s), or half of it ex-tail;
- **~1,120 s of interning could not be overlapped** at one writer (2,230 − 1,110), which is
  what `queueing`'s 1,019 s is from the other side;
- **Glean's entire load is 579 s** — parsing 6.6 GB of JSON, interning 94.9M nested
  references into 25.0M facts, renaming local ids onto global ones, committing, and sealing
  — against **2,037.7 s inside `Write` plus 327 s of `finish`** on ours. **3.5×**, with
  Glean paying a JSON parse we do not.

Ex-tail, end to end and sealed: **Glean 1,689 s, Fjord 2,155 s at four writers, 2,557 s
at one.** Glean is 1.28× the four-writer run despite writing every fact twice — once as
JSON, once into the database — and despite no overlap whatsoever between its two phases.

**And it stores the same 25M facts in 886 MB against 3.2 GB.** 3.7× on disk (2× on the
logical figures each system reports: 1.53 GiB against 3.11 GiB). Three candidates, none
measured yet: dense 4–5 byte ids against our 8-byte `FactId` with its predicate tag,
RocksDB's compression against fjall's defaults, and our two column families storing a key
in `keys` and again inside the row in `entities`.

**What this does not say.** Glean's load is one process reading local files with `-j 8`;
ours is a socket round trip per block into a server interning under per-key exclusion. That
is a real difference between the two pipelines and not a handicap either side was given —
but it means the 3.5× is *pipeline against pipeline*, not interner against interner. The
number that would separate those is the write rung
([§13](#13-the-write-rung-committing-is-41-of-interning-and-the-cache-is-worth-23-of-a-resolve-pass))
run over this corpus rather than a synthetic one. Two things already point at where ours
goes: summed `writing` per fact *grows* with the tree (15c), and it barely improved when the
lookup cache landed — 2,395.5 → 2,037.7 s for the same 94.9M interns, when 73.6% of them
are re-reads it should be absorbing.

## 16. Without `src/tests`: 19.6k facts/s, and the cache is at its ceiling — 73.05% against an available 73.12%

**What was measured.** The same producer and flags as [§15](#15-fjord-and-glean-over-one-corpus-and-one-producer-the-walk-is-30-the-tail-is-45-and-gleans-write-path-is-35-cheaper),
four writers, with `--exclude src/tests` — 26,924 of 32,710 files. §15b said the tail was a
corpus decision; this is that decision taken, and it is a **larger** cut than the tail
arithmetic predicted.

| | 4 writers, whole `src/` | 4 writers, no `src/tests` |
|---|---|---|
| files / facts | 32,710 / 25,046,499 | 26,924 / **18,291,006** |
| walk + ingest | 3,751 s | **935 s** |
| throughput | 6,677 f/s (13,795 ex-tail) | **19,563 f/s** |
| queueing | 271.4 s | **70.3 s** (7.5%) |
| gate wait / held (8 walkers) | 3,256 / 644 s | 2,670 / 336 s |
| `finish` | 344 s | 220 s |
| sealed | 25,012,490 facts, 3.2 GB | 18,258,385 facts, 2.4 GB |
| peak RSS, indexer / server | 20.0 / 1.7 GB | **9.4** / 1.8 GB |

**`src/tests` was 27.0% of the facts and 75.1% of the wall clock.** Excluding it is worth
more than removing the tail, because the tail cut only dropped the last 16 files while the
tree carries pathological generated code all through the walk — and it halves peak memory,
which hands the page cache back to the LSM the earlier runs were starving. Against the
pre-upgrade baseline this is **3.94×**; against §15's ex-tail four-writer figure, 1.42×.

### 16a. The lookup cache, watched rather than autopsied

`fjord.db.Interning` sampled every 30 s through the ingest, and the last sample after the
seal:

| elapsed | hits | misses | `keys` | `entities` | hit rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 181 s | 8,785,048 | 3,277,672 | 3,277,672 | 200 | 72.8% |
| 361 s | 20,538,006 | 7,606,218 | 7,606,244 | 6,174 | 73.1% |
| 451 s | 25,575,714 | 9,457,806 | 9,457,819 | 9,783 | 73.0% |
| final | 49,614,896 | 18,303,664 | **18,303,664** | 29,026 | **73.05%** |

**73.05% against a ceiling of 73.12%**, because 73.12% of this corpus's resolves are repeats
— a perfect cache scores that and a useless one scores zero. Flat across 67.9M resolves, no
decay.

**`keys` equals `misses` exactly**, and that identity is the whole finding. An eviction can
only show up one way: a resolve that misses the cache and then *finds* the fact in the trees
— a miss and a probe that creates nothing. It is pinned from both sides,
`misses − created` = `deduped − hits` = **45,279**, which is 0.067% of resolves. So the
128 MiB-per-generation budget rotated a hot parent out about once in 1,500 resolves at 18.3M
facts, and [§15](#15-fjord-and-glean-over-one-corpus-and-one-producer-the-walk-is-30-the-tail-is-45-and-gleans-write-path-is-35-cheaper)'s
worry about the ~100 MB hot set is closed. `entities` is 0.043%: the key-only fast path
removing the second tree read, confirmed on real data for the first time.

**Block-local dedup fired zero times**, which is worth recording because it looks like dead
code and is not: `intern` checks the block's own uncommitted `pending` map first, and a
nested parent is only ever *created* in an earlier block, so the cache answers before that
map can. It earns its place as the correctness backstop the comment says it is — a staged id
the trees cannot yet answer for — not as an optimisation.

### 16b. What is the ceiling now

**Not the write path.** `queueing` is 7.5% and the cache is at its arithmetic maximum. The
walkers spent 2,670 s summed blocked on `Indexer._gate` — ~334 s each, 36% of the run —
which makes the producer's own serialisation the largest remaining term, and it is
`clients/dotnet`'s to fix rather than the database's.

**What interning still costs is one `keys` probe per created fact, plus staging, commit and
wire decode.** With `keys == misses` there is nothing left to remove by caching; the next
number has to come from splitting that residue, which is
[§13](#13-the-write-rung-committing-is-41-of-interning-and-the-cache-is-worth-23-of-a-resolve-pass)'s
write rung run over this corpus rather than a synthetic one.

## 17. On equal footing the two write paths are within 8%, and §15's 3.5× was mostly memory pressure

**What was measured.** The Glean side of [§16](#16-without-srctests-196k-factss-and-the-cache-is-at-its-ceiling--7305-against-an-available-7312)'s
corpus: same producer, same flags, `--exclude src/tests`, 26,924 files. Both databases hold
**18,258,385 facts and all 27 predicates agree stored-for-stored** — verified by counting
each one on both sides, not by trusting the totals.

| | Fjord (4 writers) | Glean |
|---|---|---|
| the walk | fused with ingest | **emit 502 s** (36,445 f/s) |
| ingest | fused; 2,668 s summed over 4 writers | **load 352 s** |
| seal | `finish` **220 s** | inside the load |
| walk + ingest, indexer's clock | 882 s (20,730 f/s) | 502 s |
| **end to end, sealed** | **1,102 s** | **854 s** (1.29×) |
| intermediate | none | 4.9 GB of JSON (285 B/fact) |
| on disk | 2.4 GB (2.36 GiB logical) | **659 MB** (1.11 GiB logical) |
| peak RSS | indexer 9.4 GB, server 1.8 GB | emit 9.1 GB, load 976 MB |

### 17a. The emit prices the walk, and what is left is the write path

The emit's sink costs 60 s over 4,483 blocks and its `queueing` is 0.3 s, so **the walk's own
cost is ~502 s** and everything above it is interning that failed to hide behind it:

- **Fjord's ingest costs 380 s of wall clock** it could not overlap (882 − 502);
- **Glean's entire load costs 352 s** — parsing 4.9 GB of JSON, interning 68M nested
  references into 18.26M facts, renaming local ids onto global ones, committing, and sealing.

**Those are within 8% of each other.** [§15](#15-fjord-and-glean-over-one-corpus-and-one-producer-the-walk-is-30-the-tail-is-45-and-gleans-write-path-is-35-cheaper)
reported 3.5× on the same comparison and named the likely confound in its own text: Glean's
load ran alone on the box after the walk had exited, while our server interned with a
16–20 GB Roslyn process squeezing 30 GB of RAM down to ~3 GB of page cache. Dropping
`src/tests` halves the indexer's peak to 9.4 GB, and the difference goes away. **So the write
paths are close to equal, and §15's number was mostly the harness.** Per-fact summed write
cost fell 28% between the two runs (203 → 146 µs) for the same code, which is the same story
told by the other end.

**What still separates them end to end is our `finish`.** 220 s of merging trees and hashing
an identity, which Glean does inside its 352 s. Take that out and the two are 1,102 − 220 =
882 s against 854 s — 3%. Whether sealing can be folded into ingest, or is simply the price
of [`ops-I4`](../website/content/operations.md)'s content hash being computable at all, is a
question this makes worth asking.

### 17b. Two things the comparison did not set out to measure

**Storage is still 3.7× on disk** (659 MB against 2.4 GB), 2.1× on the logical figures each
system reports. Nothing here explains it, and it is the one gap that also acts on the read
path — a database that fits in cache is a database that scans faster, which is
[Phase 13](glean-read-path.md)'s F5.

**The indexer's gate amplifies ~12×, and this run measured it by accident.** The same walk,
two sinks:

| | gate held | gate wait (8 walkers) | queueing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Glean sink (files) | 187.9 s | 928.1 s | 0.3 s |
| Fjord sink (socket) | 335.9 s | 2,669.8 s | 70.3 s |

**148 s more time holding the gate costs 1,742 s of summed walker wait.** That is the cheapest
lever left on the producer side and it is `clients/dotnet`'s, not the database's: the gate is
held across memoisation lookups *and* across `Add`, so a slower sink widens a critical section
eight threads are queued behind.

## 18. The plateau was the connect and the allocator, not the engine — 27× from pooling a connection, 5–13% from mimalloc

**What was asked.** [Issue #19](https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/issues/19): heavy read load
plateaued at ~9 of ~14 available cores, which read as an internal limit on how many scans the
server will run at once. It is not one. Two costs *outside* the engine were being read as one
inside it — **a process and a connection per request** on the client's side, and **glibc's
per-arena mutexes** on a scan path that allocates per chunk. No guard the project has can see
either: [I9](../website/content/invariants.md#i9) holds, and holds *per row*, while every
allocation the contention is about is per chunk or per opened level — which is exactly what I9's
own caveat exempts.

**The tree.** `main` at `0184a57` plus the change this section justifies. The two arms of the
allocator comparison are that source built twice, once with the `#[global_allocator]` attribute
and once with it commented out; nothing else differs between the binaries.

**The instrument.** `examples/loadgen.rs` against `fjord serve`, release, with `--only` to hold
one workload still across arms and `Connection::discard` so the generator does not decode the
rows it asks for. The database is loadgen's own seed — 6,000 files, 30,000 declarations, 156,000
facts created and 330,000 deduped — small enough to sit in page cache, because the question is
contention between threads and not the disk.

**Two hosts, and they agree on the sign and not the size.** *This box* is the host the rest of
this register uses — 8 cores, 32 GB — with the load generator resident on the same cores as the
server. *The issue's box* is #19's: a shared 80-core machine with a ~14-core cpuset, where the
generator was not competing for the server's cores. Ratios travel further than absolutes, but
not this ratio: what it depends on is how many cores the generator is taking.

### 18a. A connection per request costs 27×, and it is the whole plateau

Same server, same database, same one-row seek, 500 queries an arm, arms alternating over three
rounds (*this box*):

| What a request pays for | Queries/s | Per query |
|---|---|---|
| `fjord query` — a process and a connection each time | 199–205 | 4.88–5.03 ms |
| One pooled `Connection`, sequential | 4,682–6,743 | 135–190 µs (p50) |
| Eight pooled connections | 24,936 | 255 µs (p50) |

**27× on one connection and 122× on eight, with the server identical in all three rows.** Where
the 4.9 ms goes, by subtraction against the same loop running `fjord --version` (3.78–3.91 ms)
and `/bin/true` (1.00 ms):

| | Per request |
|---|---|
| The shell's own fork and exec | ~1.0 ms |
| Starting `fjord` — dynamic link, argument parse, config | ~2.9 ms |
| Socket, handshake, schema, teardown | ~0.9 ms |
| **Answering the query** | **0.15 ms** |

**Three per cent of the request is the database.** On the issue's box the same shape capped a
bridge at ~580 req/s with fewer than nine scans ever in flight, against a server that saturated
all fourteen cores when driven from pooled connections. The plateau was a client that could not
ask fast enough, and no server-side change would have moved it.

**What it costs to act on.** Nothing in the server. It is written down for consumers as
[Hold the connection](../website/content/clients.md) — pool connections and keep them, and leave
`fjord query` to people. `examples/loadgen.rs` and `examples/soak.rs` were already built that
way, which is why they measure the server rather than the connect path.

### 18b. mimalloc is worth 5–13% here and 38% at core saturation

One database, eight connections, 40 runs a workload, the two binaries alternating over three
rounds (*this box*):

| Workload | glibc p50 | mimalloc p50 | Faster | Queries/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| scan decls | 165.5 ms | 156.7 ms | 5.3% | 47 → 50 |
| project record | 189.7 ms | 170.6 ms | **10.1%** | 41 → 46 |
| fetch, project a string | 262.5 ms | 237.5 ms | 9.5% | 30 → 33 |
| join on a leading field | 275.0 ms | 255.8 ms | 7.0% | 28 → 30 |

Medians of three rounds — and **mimalloc won all twelve round-pairs**, by 4.7% to 14.5%, with the
arms never overlapping. That is what makes a single-digit claim worth making on a box this noisy.

On the issue's box, fed by pooled connections at 24 concurrent heavy counts, the same swap is
**441 → 609 q/s (+38%)** with cores in use going 13.5 → 13.9, and stacks sampled under load
showed threads parked in `malloc` on glibc's arena mutexes. Here the generator sits on the same
eight cores as the server and takes its share, so 5–13% is what is left of that. The direction
reproduces; the size is a property of the host, and neither number is what a deployment sees.

**The first pass at this said the opposite, and the method is the reason.** Run as a full
catalogue pass per binary — glibc, then mimalloc — each arm takes about forty minutes, because
the catalogue's slowest workload examines 900M rows. The two halves therefore ran under different
host load, and mimalloc came out *worse* on `denial` (161 → 247 ms) and `scan refs` (144 → 167
ms) while better on eight others. Four workloads, alternating arms, three rounds — which is what
`--only` exists for — makes the comparison one the host's drift lands on both sides of, and the
sign becomes consistent.

**Why the scan path is exposed at all.** Per row it allocates nothing, and
[I9](../website/content/invariants.md#i9)'s guard proves it. Per *chunk* it allocates several
times — block decompression inside fjall (`lz4_flex`), the row decode, `rows::to_wire` — and
opening a level allocates once per outer row of a join, which is the caveat I9 records. Many
threads, short-lived allocations, one arena set: that is the shape glibc serialises and
mimalloc's per-thread caches do not.

### 18c. What measuring it needed, and what now holds it

- **`Connection::discard`** — a result read to its end with no row decoded. Decoding them made
  the co-resident generator take ~40% of the box (#19's appendix), so a throughput number taken
  with `drain` was partly a measurement of the client. Guarded by
  `discarding_is_flat_in_the_length_of_the_result`: peak live bytes over a 4,000-row result
  against a 1-row result, drained and discarded, asserting the held one grows with the result and
  the discarded one does not.
- **`loadgen --only`** — the A/B lever above, and a misspelt name exits 2 rather than reporting a
  table with no rows.
- **`the_global_allocator_is_mimalloc`** — the attribute is a whole-program choice with no
  compile-time evidence that it took, so the guard asks mimalloc whether a live allocation is in
  one of its own heap regions. Its mutation control was run: comment the attribute out and the
  test fails. It passes for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` too, so the static release binary carries
  the same allocator — and that build now needs a C compiler for musl in CI, because mimalloc is
  a C library and a pure-Rust cross build never wanted one.

## What is still open

- **Finding 7's number, after its fix.** The per-query retention had a cause, the cause has a
  fix in the tree, and nobody has re-run the instrument — so "~3.5 kB per query" is what the
  code used to do and there is no measurement of what it does now. First thing to re-run, and
  the cheapest: one connection, 200,000 point lookups, watch RSS.
- **F6** — the reader head-of-line blocking on a ≥3-block ingest. The only hypothesis left
  untouched, and the only one that needs a *write* path: every database measured here is
  `Complete`. It wants a writable database, a slow funnel and a client that sends three
  blocks without waiting.
- **F4's last 3.6×** is split no further. Finding 9 separates the row encoder from
  everything above it, but "everything above it" is still one number covering the frame, the
  outbound mutex, the socket and the client's decode. Splitting *that* is what S4 proper —
  `breakdown.rs` extended to a data query — would do.
- **F8** (no admission control) is *observed* rather than measured: 2048 connections were
  accepted without complaint and nothing was ever refused, which is the predicted behaviour.
  Latency, never rejection.
- **F5** — blocked on finding 4, as above.
- **The scaling curve across *corpus sizes*** rather than across predicates. What is
  published here is one 18M-fact database whose predicates span 142 → 8.58M rows, which is
  a scan-size curve on real data at fixed database size. The 10k → 10M curve the phase
  plan asks for needs `index-repo.sh --max-files` bands, and each band is hours of
  indexing that must not run while anything is being measured.
- **No baseline file.** `bench/baselines/<host>.json` and the `--json` flag are not built;
  these numbers live in this document and are reproduced by re-running the instrument.
- **The write rung stops below the wire.** Finding 13 built it and it separates committing from
  resolving from decoding — but in process only. The server, the framing and the per-stream
  queueing are not in it, so finding 12's "47% of the run inside the blocking `Write` call" is
  still attributed to a call rather than to a layer. That wants the same treatment S4/S5 gave
  the read path, over a write stream.
- **Finding 13 is a synthetic corpus.** The ratio is dialled to bracket the real one, not taken
  from it. Re-measuring finding 12 through the rung needs a `dotnet/runtime` re-index — hours,
  and it must not run while anything else is being measured. The re-index now exists
  ([§15](#15-fjord-and-glean-over-one-corpus-and-one-producer-the-walk-is-30-the-tail-is-45-and-gleans-write-path-is-35-cheaper)),
  so what is left is running the rung over it — and [§15d](#15d-what-the-glean-run-separates-that-no-fjord-run-could)
  is why that matters: the 3.5× against Glean is pipeline against pipeline, and only the rung
  splits interning from the socket.
- **The interning lookup cache is measured and closed** —
  [§16a](#16a-the-lookup-cache-watched-rather-than-autopsied): 73.05% of an available 73.12%
  at 18.3M facts, `keys` equal to `misses` exactly, and 45,279 resolves (0.067%) as the whole
  cost of eviction. What follows is below, and it is no longer about caching.
- **The interning lookup cache is now visible, and on a small corpus it is perfect.**
  `fjord.db.Interning` reports it as facts, so a running server can be asked
  (`:interning` in the shell). Over this repository's own `clients/dotnet` — 14,072 facts,
  36,093 deduped — it answers `hits 36,093, misses 14,072, keys 14,072, entities 0`: **every
  repeat reference was a cache hit**, every miss was a genuinely new fact costing exactly one
  `keys` read, and the key-only fast path removed the second read entirely. So the ~21 µs an
  intern costs on the big corpus is **not** re-reading parents, and the candidates left are the
  one unavoidable `keys` probe per created fact, staging, the commit, and the wire decode —
  which is [§13](#13-the-write-rung-committing-is-41-of-interning-and-the-cache-is-worth-23-of-a-resolve-pass)'s
  split, now worth running over the real corpus.
  **What a small corpus cannot say** is whether the cache still holds at 25M facts: the budget
  is 128 MiB per generation against a hot parent set the code estimates at ~100 MB, so the
  25M-fact re-index is where a rotation would show up — as `hits` falling and `keys` climbing
  past the created count. That measurement is now one query.
- **Storage is 3.7× Glean's for the same facts** (886 MB against 3.2 GB sealed). Three candidates
  named in [§15d](#15d-what-the-glean-run-separates-that-no-fjord-run-could), none measured.
- **The writer count wants to be adaptive**, not a flag: the crossover in
  [§15c](#15c-the-ingestion-upgrade-is-157-and-concurrent-writers-cross-over-at-16000-files) is a
  property of tree depth, which the server knows and the producer does not.
- **The corpus includes a file that is 45% of it.** [§15b](#15b-the-tail-one-generated-file-is-45-of-the-wall-clock-and-contributes-365-facts).
  Quote ex-tail, or drop `src/tests` and re-baseline — a decision to take before the next
  measurement rather than after it.
- **The allocator's 38% has not been reproduced on a quiet host.**
  [§18b](#18b-mimalloc-is-worth-513-here-and-38-at-core-saturation) has two numbers for one
  change and the difference is the load generator's share of the cores. What would settle it is
  the generator on another machine, or the server on its own cpuset — a `taskset` and a second
  box, not a new instrument.
- **Nothing here measures the static build.** Both release binaries now carry the same allocator,
  so that is no longer what separates them, but every number in this register is from the
  dynamically linked one. What is untested is musl's libc under a server's load.
- **The consumer that provoked [§18a](#18a-a-connection-per-request-costs-27-and-it-is-the-whole-plateau)
  has not been migrated.** The finding is recorded and the guidance is in the book; the bridge
  that shells out per request is somebody's code and still does.

## Appendix — the eight hypotheses, read out of the code before anything was measured

Written before the first instrument ran, kept because a gap analysis edited to match the
outcome is one nobody can calibrate against. Each was a *prediction* with the rung that
settles it; the verdicts were filled in as the rungs ran. Inspection is not evidence here —
that is the project's founding methodological claim, and ✅/⛔ below is its scorecard.

Inspection is not evidence here — that is the project's founding methodological claim. Each
of these is a *prediction* with the rung that settles it and the number that would.

| # | Hypothesis | Where it comes from | Settled by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** ✅ | **Stream tasks leak, per query.** `read_loop`'s `streams: HashMap<u32, StreamHandle>` (`session.rs:316`) has no removal path anywhere in the file; the client's `claim_stream` (`client/connection.rs:528`) never reuses an id. A connection issuing 10k queries leaves 10k parked tokio tasks, each holding `Arc<Session>`, `Arc<Outbound>`, a `CancellationToken` and an `mpsc(2)` buffer, until the *connection* closes — **true, and the mechanism is as described: ~3.5 kB retained per query, growth strictly proportional to queries issued on a connection, so 200k point lookups for one key took the server from 243 MB to 892 MB. It is *bounded*, though — a third such connection added 35 MB where the first added 649, and a realistic population reconnecting between queries retains 58 bytes/query. What it sets is a high-water mark for the busiest connection, not a restart schedule (§7)** | S7 — RSS and live-task count against **queries issued**, not connections open |
| **F2** ⛔ | **A mid-chunk cancel reports `ErrorCode::Internal`, not a clean end.** `CANCELLATION_STRIDE = 4096` counts rows *examined* (`iter.rs:389`); `CHUNK_ROWS = 256` counts rows *produced*. A selective query trips the stride inside a chunk → `FjordError::Cancelled` → `ServerError::Execution` (`session.rs:859`) → an ERROR frame, where the design says *"a cancel is an early end, not a failure"*. Under load this is the common case, and no test covers the branch — **refuted: cancelling the most stride-tripping query available (56,274 examined per row produced) returns a clean end, sends no error frame, and leaves the connection usable. Tested through the client API and through `query --limit`** | S4 / S6 — cancel the `denial` workload and read the frame kind |
| **F3** ✅ | **No plan cache.** Every query is parsed, typechecked, flattened and reordered afresh on the blocking pool (`session.rs:577`). At a ~211 µs floor on 4 cores that is a ceiling of roughly 19k q/s whatever the query does — **true, and small: 4–14 µs, 2–7% of the floor, linear in query size (§5)** | S2 — compile µs as a fraction of the floor |
| **F4** ✅ | **Per-row framing dominates above ~100k row/s.** One `DATA_ROW` frame per row: ~3 allocations, 2 outbound-mutex acquisitions and a `Notify` each (`session.rs:617`, `outbound.rs:90-122`, `rows.rs`) — **confirmed as significant but misattributed: the row *encoder* is 1.5× (2.1× where the projection builds a record), and the framing, socket and client decode above it are a further 3.6× (§9)** | S4 — row/s with framing against S1 row/s without |
| **F5** ⛔ | **A chunk has no byte budget.** `CHUNK_ROWS` is row-bounded only, so 256 wide rows materialise unbounded memory on a blocking thread (`session.rs:863`). The only byte cap in the system is `MAX_PAYLOAD` = 64 MiB, and it is per frame — **not reachable from the query side: a fact's *value* cannot be read by a query at all, so the widest row buildable is three narrow key fields (§4)** | S1 / S4 — a wide-row workload, RSS at the chunk boundary |
| **F6** | **The reader head-of-line blocks the whole connection.** `read_loop` *awaits* `handle.inbound.send(..)` on a channel of capacity **2** (`session.rs:353`); a third frame for a busy stream stalls the connection's reader — including the read that would pick up a CANCEL for a *different* stream. `write_blocks` fires every block then `COPY_DONE` without waiting (`client/connection.rs:242`) | S4 / S6 — a ≥3-block ingest against a slow funnel |
| **F7** ✅ | **Paging is not free.** Per 256 rows: two clones, a `spawn_blocking` dispatch, a **fresh fjall snapshot**, and `Executor::resume` replaying **one seek per plan level** (`iter.rs:1116`) — deliberately uncounted by `Profile`. A 1M-row query is ~3,900 of each — **true; the snapshot is free (0.1 µs) and the replayed seek is all of it: 4–12 µs a page, ~10%. On an *uncompacted* store the same seek costs up to 790 µs, +729% (§1)** | S1 — the same plan straight through vs suspended every 256 rows |
| **F8** ~ | **No admission control of any kind.** No connection cap, no query timeout, no max rows, no concurrency limiter. tokio defaults apply: **4** worker threads (this box), **512** blocking threads, an **unbounded** submission queue. 1000 in-flight queries means 512 running and the rest queued invisibly — latency, never rejection — **observed exactly so: 2048 connections accepted without complaint, nothing ever refused, zero errors, and the queue showed up as the expensive class's p50 rising from 43 s to 315 s while the cheap class stayed under 101 ms** | S6 — the latency distribution at the knee |

Two more findings from reading that need no rung, recorded so nobody re-derives them:

- **Write load does not scale with connections, by design.** One writer mutex per database
  held *across* the ingest (`session.rs:518`), and `put_fact` does one point read plus one
  fjall batch commit per fact. Adding writer connections adds queueing, and a waiting
  writer parks its connection's reader (F6). `loadgen` seeds on one connection, correctly.
- **`remove` under load is essentially always refused** — `Arc::try_unwrap` is the liveness
  test (`registry.rs:229`), so with N sessions bound there are N+1 references. Expected.
