# Changelog

Fjord DB. Dates are the release date; `0.x` is a pre-release series and the on-disk format is
not promised to be stable across its minor versions — a database written by one is read by the
version that wrote it. What *is* promised inside a series is the append-only discipline the
format stamp and the marker table enforce: nothing already written is renumbered.

## Unreleased

### `fjord` allocates from mimalloc

The tool links mimalloc as its `#[global_allocator]`, which is a whole-program choice and so
belongs in the binary rather than in a library every consumer would inherit it through. Under
concurrent scans glibc serialises the scan path's per-chunk allocations on its per-arena
mutexes; mimalloc's per-thread caches do not. Measured at 5–13% on an 8-core box with the load
generator resident on it and +38% at core saturation on a 14-core one —
[`bench/FINDINGS.md` §18](bench/FINDINGS.md). `the_global_allocator_is_mimalloc` is the guard
that catches the attribute going missing, since dropping it leaves a binary that still builds
and passes, only slower.

Both published binaries carry it, the statically linked one included, so the allocator is no
longer what separates them — what separates them is musl's libc, and nothing is measured on
that build.

### `Connection::discard`

A result read to its end with **no row decoded** — the server does the whole query, and the
client stops short of the one cost that is only ever the client's. It is what a load generator
should consume with, and it is not a cancel: nothing is cut short, so what it reports is the
server's own count. Decoding rows in a co-resident generator took ~40% of the box, which made
every throughput number partly a measurement of the generator.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-21

The first published artifact. Everything below is *what is there*, and the
[gaps](#what-is-not-in-it) are as much of the release as the features.

### Install

```bash
cargo add fjord-db                              # the Rust client
dotnet add package Boxops.Fjord.Client          # the .NET client
```

Or take the binary — `fjord`, the tool, and `fjord-viewer`, the code-search site — from the
release, which carries SLSA provenance naming the workflow that built it:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/boxops-uk/fjord/releases/latest/download/fjord
chmod +x fjord
gh attestation verify ./fjord --repo boxops-uk/fjord
./fjord --help
```

Each release also carries `fjord-x86_64-linux-musl` and `fjord-viewer-x86_64-linux-musl`: the
same code linked statically, with no glibc floor at all, for an older distro, Alpine or a
`scratch` container. Take those only if the one above will not run — musl's allocator is
slower under the load a server puts on it.

**Linux x86_64**, dynamically linked, needing **glibc 2.34 or newer** — Ubuntu 22.04, Debian
12, RHEL 9 and anything later. That is measured on the binary CI produces rather than inferred
from the runner it is built on. The store root's lock is POSIX `flock` and the default
transport is a Unix socket, so Windows is out of scope rather than untested; other Unix targets
are expected to work and are not built or tested by CI.

### The engine runs in a browser, and the design book runs it

The storage seam split from its backends — `fjord-store` is the `FactStore` trait and the
shared fixtures, `fjord-store-mem` and `fjord-store-fjall` are the two implementations — which
is what lets the engine compile to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with no filesystem under it.
`fjord-inspect` is the JSON view of every construct (tokens, the parse tree, the lowered tree,
the plan, a run's steps, the stored rows), and `wasm/` is the module that carries them into a
page: 366 KB, 151 KB over the wire.

So [the design book](https://boxops-uk.github.io/fjord/) *is* the engine. A `:::demo` block in
a page is a running lexer, parser, typechecker, planner, executor or database table, editable
in place, and `/playground` is every view of one query at once with the executor steppable over
real rows. The pages are `website/content/`, parsed by both renderers rather than copied, and
the smoke check compares them page for page — a dialect that drifts is a page that reads
differently depending on which copy you found. `python3 website/serve.py` is still the copy
that reads with no toolchain.

### The documentation is one body, and it is tested

The design book is the website, verified claim by claim against the tree; its
invariants page is the canonical registry. `AGENTS.md` is the working contract for
contributors, `PLAN.md` is a roadmap rather than a phase tree (with the auth design and the
settled-decisions record inside it), and the two Glean documents merged into `docs/glean.md`.
CI builds the site strictly and runs `scripts/check-docs.py`, which fails on a broken link, an
invariant citation the registry does not declare, a reference to a retired document, or a
build-plan phase number in code — each a way the documentation actually went stale once.

**And it is published by the same pipeline that ships the binaries.** Every push to main
deploys the interactive site to <https://boxops-uk.github.io/fjord/> — after the suite, the
drift gate, and the bundle being driven in a real browser — and every release carries that
bundle as an attested `fjord-docs-site.tar.gz`. Every page in it is a file rather than a
fallback, so a link into the middle of the book is a page and not a 404.

**Every error state is demonstrated by a test** that provokes it and asserts it at its
contract layer, fjall/OS bubbles excepted; the engine's corpus gate now covers every
diagnostic code, not only the deferrals. Comments across the workspace state the risk they
guard rather than the history of how the code got there.

### What is in it

- **An immutable fact database.** A database is created against a schema, written to, sealed,
  and thereafter only read. Facts are typed records identified by a `FactId`, grouped by
  predicate, stored in an LSM.
- **sigla**, a typed Datalog-flavoured query language: generators, joins, records, field
  access, constants and folding, aliases, constraints, denials, four comparisons, integer
  arithmetic, negation, disjunction, `never`, subqueries, and references followed in both
  directions.
- **A suspendable executor.** A query suspends to a bytes-only cursor and resumes exactly,
  releasing its snapshot at every chunk boundary — so a page held for an hour costs what one
  held for a millisecond does.
- **A schema language.** Files, namespaces, imports, a canonical form, per-predicate and
  whole-schema fingerprints, subset-containment compatibility, and `schema check` /
  `fingerprint` / `diff`.
- **Union types**, with **explicit append-only discriminants** — `{ num : int = 3 | text :
  string = 0 }`. A tag is written down rather than taken from the position, because a derived
  one renumbers the moment an alternative is inserted and every value already written then
  reads as a different alternative. Written and matched as `{alt = p}`, selected as `X.alt?`,
  and where the union is a leading key field, matching an alternative is a **seek** rather than
  a filter.
- **A wire protocol**, with a second implementation in C# that shares no code with the Rust
  one and a byte-for-byte golden test between the two encoders.
- **Parallel ingestion.** Many writers per database, behind per-key exclusion striped 64 ways.
- **A server**, a **client**, a **command-line tool**, and a **code-search site** built on
  nothing but the client.

### What is not in it

Stated because a missing feature discovered by a user is worse than one written down.

| Missing | What it means for you |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | None, by design at this stage. The transport is the trust boundary: the server binds a Unix socket, TCP is opt-in per invocation, and access control belongs to a gateway in front |
| **`maybe` and `enum`** | Both are sugar over a union, which *is* there — but each needs a naming decision that enters the schema fingerprint, so both still parse and report themselves. Write the union out |
| **Stored derivation** | A derived predicate cannot be *declared*. Derived data is written by hand, which is what four predicates in the sample schema are |
| **Ingestion from files** | Facts arrive over the wire from a producer. The file format is defined and the pipeline is not wired to a command |
| **Arrays and sets** | A one-to-many is one fact per element |
| **`fjord write`, `db backup`/`restore`/`verify`, `completions`** | Named in the design, absent from the binary. A sealed database is a directory, so `tar` is the backup |
| **Per-predicate statistics** | Nothing feeds a selectivity heuristic, which is why the reorderer has none |
| **Per-stream flow control** | Bounded queues and per-connection backpressure in the meantime |
| **A resumable deadline** | A timeout unwinds terminally rather than handing back a cursor |

Two operational facts that are easy to meet and are not in that table because they are
properties of what *is* built:

- **A `Writable` database is never merged.** Trees are compacted at `finish`, so a long-lived
  ingest-then-query workflow pays unmerged-LSM seek cost until it is sealed — up to two orders
  of magnitude on a page seek. Seal before you measure read performance.
- **The interning lookup cache is a fixed budget per open database** (~256 MiB, two
  generations of 128 MiB) with no operator dial. It is measured at its ceiling at 18.3M facts
  and untested above that.

### Notes for anyone who has been tracking `main`

- **Unions landed (8.6), and nothing else moved with them.** The marker table gained `0x52`,
  *appended* — the eleven markers below it are unchanged, so every database already written is
  read by exactly the bytes that wrote it. The wire's descriptor and value tables gained a tag
  each, also appended, so an older peer meets one and says so rather than mis-reading what
  follows. `schemas/code.sigla` is deliberately untouched: a union there would move its
  fingerprint and the constants two .NET clients carry, and that is a flag day with nothing to
  do with unions working.
- **There is no built-in schema.** `fjord create` requires `--schema <file>`; a server carries
  no data schema of its own, and a database that embeds no schema copy is listed rather than
  served. `schemas/code.sigla` is a sample rather than a default.
- **`fjord shell` requires a database.** The embedded demo, and the `example/` corpus it was
  seeded from, are gone.
- **`fjord finish` used to seal against the tool's built-in schema** regardless of what the
  database embedded, which computed the content identity over misread rows for any database
  built against another schema. It reads the embedded copy now.
- The command-line tool moved to `crates/fjord-cli`, and `Connection::control` no longer takes
  a schema.
- **The .NET namespace is `Boxops.Fjord.Client`**, matching the package id — so
  `dotnet add package Boxops.Fjord.Client` is followed by `using Boxops.Fjord.Client;` and
  there is one name rather than two. The projects and the solution are renamed to match.
