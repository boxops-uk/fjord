/// <para>
/// <b>A full block is handed to a writer thread, not written where it filled.</b> The
/// walk holds <c>Indexer._gate</c> across every <see cref="Add"/>, so writing inline
/// meant one walker thread sat in a network round trip and a server intern — measured
/// at 368 ms per block — while the other seven blocked on the lock. On the 25M-fact
/// <c>dotnet/runtime</c> index that was 2255s of 4828s, and it is why <see cref="Add"/>
/// now only detaches the full list and queues it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Several writers, each with its own target.</b> The server excludes writers per
/// <em>key</em> rather than per database, so a database takes as many as there are
/// streams. One connection cannot carry them: <see cref="FjordConnection"/> issues
/// streams sequentially and shares one socket, so concurrency here means one connection
/// per writer thread and nothing shared between them but the queue. What a writer holds
/// is an <see cref="IBlockTarget"/> rather than a connection, because a block is the same
/// thing whichever database it is going into — see that interface for why.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The queue is bounded, and that bound is the backpressure.</b> An unbounded queue
/// would convert a stall into memory rather than into throughput. The bound scales with
/// the writer count, because the thing it has to keep fed is now several drains rather
/// than one. When the walk outruns them, producers block in <see cref="Queueing"/> —
/// which is what says whether the write path is still the ceiling.
/// </para>
