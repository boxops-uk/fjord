# The .NET client

A C# implementation of Fjord's wire protocol, and a console program that uses it to
write facts into a real database and query them back.

It exists to answer a question the Rust tests cannot: **is the protocol implementable
from outside?** A client written in the same repository, against the same types, can
agree with the server by accident — sharing a constant, sharing an enum, sharing an
assumption nobody wrote down. This one shares nothing but the specification, and it
found two things the Rust side had not: a block header length stated in one place and
miscounted in another, and a fingerprint that would have depended on the client's byte
order.

| Project | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Boxops.Fjord.Client` | the library: varints, CRC-32, the value codec, blocks, frames, the handshake, a connection. **The one packable project** — published as `Boxops.Fjord.Client`, targeting `net8.0` and `net10.0`, with no dependencies |
| `Boxops.Fjord.Demo` | a console program that writes a small code index and queries it |
| `Boxops.Fjord.Indexer` | a **real** indexer — Buildalyzer and Roslyn over a .NET checkout, at whatever size the checkout is ([its README](Boxops.Fjord.Indexer/README.md)) |

## As a package

```bash
dotnet add package Boxops.Fjord.Client
```

`Boxops.Fjord.Client/README.md` is the package's front page, and its example is compiled against
this library rather than written next to it. Shared metadata — version, licence, repository,
Source Link, deterministic build — is in `Directory.Build.props`, and nothing there is
packable unless it says so, which is how the two console programs stay out of the feed.

```bash
dotnet pack clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Client -c Release -o ./nupkg
```

That produces the `.nupkg` and a `.snupkg` of symbols. CI runs the same two commands, so a
package that would not build is a red branch rather than a discovery at publish time.

## Running it

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo build --bin fjord

rm -rf /tmp/fj-demo && mkdir -p /tmp/fj-demo
./target/debug/fjord --data-dir /tmp/fj-demo/db create code
./target/debug/fjord --data-dir /tmp/fj-demo/db serve \
    --socket /tmp/fj-demo/fjord.sock \
    --ready-file /tmp/fj-demo/ready &

# `--ready-file` appears only once the listener is accepting, so waiting on it is a
# signal rather than a race.
while [ ! -e /tmp/fj-demo/ready ]; do sleep 0.1; done

dotnet run --project clients/dotnet/Boxops.Fjord.Demo -- --socket /tmp/fj-demo/fjord.sock
```

Or `./clients/dotnet/run-demo.sh`, which is the above.

## What the demo shows

**A producer that holds no fact ids.** Every reference it writes is the target fact
itself, nested inline, two levels deep — a declaration names its module, which names
its file. It keeps no map from entities to identities and emits in whatever order it
likes. The server interns each target and substitutes the id.

That is the whole reason a reference on the way in is a fact rather than an id. An
indexer walking a syntax tree knows the file when it reaches the declaration; every
id-based scheme would make it remember what the server called things.

The counts show it working:

```
writing 6 declarations, every reference nested
  created 12, deduped 6 (of 18 facts touched)
  6 declarations + 3 modules + 3 files = 12 distinct facts

a reference with a nested-record key: created 1, deduped 4
the same declarations again: created 0, deduped 18
```

Six declarations name three modules and three files, so eighteen facts are *touched*
and twelve are *written*. The reference that follows carries a nested record in its key
and points at a declaration and a file that already exist, so one fact is created and
four dedup. Sending the same declarations again writes nothing at all — interning is
idempotent, which is what makes retrying after a dropped connection safe.

## What a client has to know, and what it does not

**It has to have the schema.** The value codec sends no field names, no type markers
and no record arities: the server has them and so does the client, and sending what the
reader already has is what a transmission-shaped format declines to do. `Schema.cs` is
that, written down — mirroring `fjord::code_index` on the Rust side, deliberately,
because two independent statements of one schema is what the fingerprint is *for*.

It has caught that too. When the server moved from a cut-down three-predicate schema to
the real code index, the demo was refused at the handshake with both fingerprints named,
before a byte of data flowed — the whole mechanism working in the one situation it exists
for. When the schema later grew from six predicates to twenty-two it was the *golden*
that spoke first — `byte_identical_with_the_dotnet_client` compares fingerprints before
it compares a single byte, and said so in one line rather than as a hex diff. That is
also why this program states all twenty-two and writes facts for six: the fingerprint is
over the schema, not over the part of it a client happens to use.

Until schemas are parsed (PLAN Phase 8) a client writes the schema out by hand and
asserts it at the handshake with a fingerprint, which is what turns "we disagree about
the schema" from a corrupted database into a refused connection. Passing
`assertSchema: false` sends `0`, meaning *do not check* — right for a reader, wrong for
a producer.

**It does not have to know how facts are stored.** The storage codec is
order-preserving, self-delimiting and frozen on disk; none of that is on the wire, and
a client never sees it.

## The flag day: what to do when `schemas/code.sigla` moves

A client sends **one** whole-schema fingerprint and the server checks it for equality, so
any edit to that file refuses every client until each one is rebuilt. The protocol carries
an alternative — per-predicate containment, which would make an *additive* change free —
and it is deliberately not used: the default schema is not expected to move often, and a
version bump is the accepted cost of the simpler client. That decision is the reason this
section exists.

Run `scripts/flag-day.sh check` at any point; it walks the steps below in order and stops
at the first stale one, because the expensive failure here is discovering step 3 after
step 7. `scripts/flag-day.sh regen` does the parts a machine can.

1. **Edit `schemas/code.sigla`.**
2. **Read the new number** — `fjord schema check schemas/code.sigla`.
3. **Paste it into the constant that states *that* schema.** The two clients are no
   longer written against one schema: `Boxops.Fjord.Demo/Program.cs` states
   `code.sigla` and `Boxops.Fjord.Indexer/DotnetIndex.cs` states `dotnet.sigla`, each
   restated independently on purpose.
   `the_dotnet_clients_carry_the_fingerprint_the_schema_has` checks each against its own,
   so a missed one is a red suite rather than a refused handshake at somebody's site.
4. **Regenerate the goldens** — `./clients/dotnet/emit-golden.sh`. This needs a .NET SDK,
   and it is the step most often forgotten because the Rust test that depends on it
   *looks* like a Rust problem.
5. **Check the Rust side still agrees** — `cargo test -p fjord-client byte_identical`.
6. **Update `crates/fjord-cli/src/sample_schema.rs`**: the predicate count, `KEY_ORDER`,
   and the name lookups.
7. **Update `clients/dotnet/glean/fjbench.angle`**, the Glean translation of the same
   shapes. Nothing checks this one; the script warns.
8. **Bump the .NET package version** in the same commit that re-pastes the constant. A
   moved fingerprint *is* a client release, and an un-upgraded client's refusal is the
   designed failure — `a_schema_mismatch_is_refused_at_the_handshake` asserts it names
   both numbers, so an operator can tell a stale client from one pointed at the wrong
   database.
9. **`cargo test` and the pinned lint gate.**

A schema *re-keying* — changing a predicate's key rather than adding one — is a bigger
job than this: every query and every producer that reads the predicate moves with it, and
no script can find them. Rehearse it end to end on a branch first.

## What is not implemented

The client mirrors the server, so it stops where the server does. Streams are issued
sequentially — the ids are real and the server tags every reply with one, but this
client sends a stream's frames and reads its replies before starting the next. There is
no cancellation and no flow control. All three are named as deferred in
[operations](../../website/content/operations.md).

There is no test project: the console program *is* the test, and it is a better one
than a unit suite would be, because it runs against the real server over a real socket.
A unit test of this codec against constants copied from the Rust would prove the
constants were copied.

## The indexer

`Boxops.Fjord.Indexer` is the demo's argument made at scale: the same client library, the
same nested references and the same handshake, driven by **Buildalyzer** (a design-time
build per project, out of process) and **Roslyn** (what every name in the result means)
over a checkout of somebody's real .NET source.

```sh
./clients/dotnet/index-repo.sh ~/src/SomeSolution
```

The demo answers *is the protocol implementable from outside*. The indexer answers the
two questions after it: is it **usable** from outside by a producer with a real workload,
and does the database hold up when the facts were not chosen to be convenient. It has its
own [README](Boxops.Fjord.Indexer/README.md) — what it maps onto the twenty-two predicates,
what it resolves, and what the numbers it prints mean.

**It also writes to Glean.** `--glean-out <dir>` puts the same facts into Glean's own JSON
batch format instead, against [`glean/fjbench.angle`](glean/fjbench.angle) — a predicate,
field and *field-order* preserving translation of `schemas/code.sigla`:

```sh
./clients/dotnet/index-repo-glean.sh ~/src/SomeSolution fjbench --syntax-only
```

One walk, two sinks, so a measurement of the two systems is a measurement of the two
systems and not of two indexers. What that costs to keep honest — nested references on
both paths, `int` becoming `nat`, and the fact that emitting is not writing — is in the
indexer's README under *Into Glean instead*.
