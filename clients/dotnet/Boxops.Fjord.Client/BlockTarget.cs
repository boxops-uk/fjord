/// about Fjord. Pointing the same walk at a different fact database is then one
/// method, which is what makes a measurement of the two a measurement of the databases

/// <b>The unit is a block of one predicate</b>, because that is what both ends want: an
/// Fjord write stream carries one predicate per <c>CopyData</c> frame, and a file of

/// id — every reference is the target fact nested inline — so a target may write its
/// blocks in any order, and several targets may write at once.
