/// <b>The predicate is named, not numbered.</b> The header carried the database's
/// numeric id until Phase 8, which meant a client had to keep a table of ids in step
/// with a server's and a fact file was only meaningful against the database whose
/// numbering wrote it. A name costs about six more bytes <i>once per block</i>, against
/// payloads of hundreds to thousands of facts, and buys both back. The name sits after
/// the fixed-width fields so a splitter still reaches <c>length</c> at a fixed offset,
/// and it cannot contribute to a sync marker for the same reason a string cannot: UTF-8
/// never uses <c>0xF8</c>–<c>0xFF</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The ten <c>0xFF</c> bytes are a marker this encoding makes <i>rare</i> inside a
/// payload, not one it cannot produce. No <i>string</i> or <i>varint</i> can carry
/// one — UTF-8 never uses <c>0xF8</c>–<c>0xFF</c>, and a varint's last byte is below
/// <c>0x80</c> so a run ends where the varint does, the longest reachable being nine
/// — but a <see cref="FjordType.Bytes"/> payload is a length varint and then the
/// bytes raw, unvalidated, so ten <c>0xFF</c> inside a blob are ordinary data.
/// <b>No fixed marker can be structurally impossible in a family that carries
/// arbitrary bytes.</b> A client that emits one inside a <c>bytes</c> payload is
/// therefore writing valid facts and breaks nothing: a reader confirms the magic and
/// then the CRC, and scans on when a candidate fails. What the encoding buys is that
/// a <i>false</i> candidate is rare rather than routine — which is why the encoding
/// here still has to match rather than merely decode.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Header fields are little-endian; the checksum covers the header's own fields as
/// well as the payload, so a corrupted length is caught rather than trusted.
